    <title>Stupid Patent of the Month: Storing Files in Folders</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/stupid-patent-month-storing-files-folders</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2014/07/30/stupid-patent-square-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Our ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention&quot;&gt;Reclaim Invention&lt;/a&gt; campaign urges universities not to sell patents to trolls. This month’s stupid patent provides a good example of why. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US8473532&quot;&gt;US Patent No. 8,473,532&lt;/a&gt; (the ’532 patent), “Method and apparatus for automatic organization for computer files,” began its life with publicly-funded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latech.edu/&quot;&gt;Louisiana Tech University&lt;/a&gt;. But in September last year, it was sold to a patent troll. A flurry of lawsuits quickly followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Tech sold the ’532 patent to Micoba LLC, a company that has all the indicia of a classic patent troll. Micoba was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/31/sos_4_-_formation_date.png&quot;&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt; on September 8, 2016, just a few days before it purchased the patent. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/louisiana-tech-micoba-patent-assignment&quot;&gt;patent assignment agreement&lt;/a&gt; lists Micoba’s address as an office building located in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive-why-we-need-venue-reform-restore-fairness-patent-litigation&quot;&gt;Eastern District of Texas&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davincivirtual.com/loc/us/texas/mckinney-virtual-offices/facility-1325&quot;&gt;virtual office&lt;/a&gt; services are provided. As far as we can tell, Micoba has no purpose other than to sue with this patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does Micoba’s newly acquired patent cover? Claim 13 reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A computer system comprising a processor, memory, and software for automatically organizing computer files into folders, said software causing said computer system to execute the steps comprising:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.   providing a directory of folders, wherein substantially each of said folders is represented by a description;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.   providing a new computer file not having a location in said directory, said computer file being represented by a description;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.    comparing said description of said computer file to descriptions of a plurality of said folders along a single path from a root folder to a leaf folder; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d.   assigning said computer file to a folder having the most similar description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, put files into folders that contain similar files. Do it on a &quot;computer system&quot; (in case you were worried office workers from the 1930s might have infringed this patent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/6554315093/sizes/l&quot;&gt;software patent&lt;/a&gt;, the ’532 patent is unusually free of patent jargon and pseudo-technical babble. Its specification (this is the description of the invention that comes before the claims) does describe a method for determining when the contents of a file match a folder description. The patent proposes representing folders and files as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector&quot;&gt;vectors&lt;/a&gt; (which should reflect the frequency of particular words found within). The patent suggests assessing similarity by calculating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product&quot;&gt;dot product&lt;/a&gt; of these vectors. But, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US5832470&quot;&gt;assuming&lt;/a&gt; this was a new idea when the application was filed in 2003, many of the patent’s claims are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limited to this method. The patent effectively captures almost any technique for automatically sorting digital files into folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/31/figure_3_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-left&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;The ’532 patent issued in June 2013, about a year before the Supreme Court’s decision in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/happy-birthday-alice-two-years-busting-bad-software-patents&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alice v. CLS Bank&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, the Supreme Court held that an abstract idea (like sorting files into folders) does not become patentable simply because it is implemented on a computer. The ’532 patent should be found invalid under this standard. In our view, this patent has no value after &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; except as a litigation weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Tech &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.latech.edu/about/office_of_intellectual_property_commercialization&quot;&gt;represents&lt;/a&gt; that it “seeks industrial partners to commercialize the technology developed at Louisiana Tech for the benefit of society.” But it completely failed to consider this public interest mission when it sold the ’532 patent to Micoba. Within two months of the sale, Micoba had filed nearly a dozen cases in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive-why-we-need-venue-reform-restore-fairness-patent-litigation&quot;&gt;Eastern District of Texas&lt;/a&gt;, suing companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/micoba-v-spideroak-complaint&quot;&gt;SpiderOak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/micoba-v-dropbox-complaint&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, alleging they infringed at least claim 13 of the ’532 patent. Instead of benefiting society, Louisiana Tech unleashed a torrent of wasteful litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPX_Corporation&quot;&gt;RPX&lt;/a&gt;, Micoba is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/1034412-ip-edge-llc&quot;&gt;IP Edge&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/biggest-patent-troll-of-2014-gives-up-drops-appeal/&quot;&gt;eDekka&lt;/a&gt; (the biggest patent troll of 2014) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/1109337-bartonfalls-llc&quot;&gt;Bartonfalls&lt;/a&gt; (the winner of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/stupid-patent-month-changing-channel&quot;&gt;October 2016 Stupid Patent of the Month&lt;/a&gt; for its patent on changing the channel). Bartonfalls’ trolling campaign recently collapsed when a judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/bartonfalls-order-dismissing-complaint&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that its patent infringement contentions were “implausible on their face.” If RPX is correct that these companies are connected, Louisiana Tech has hitched its wagon to one of the biggest trolling operations in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention&quot;&gt;Reclaim Invention&lt;/a&gt; project was launched to stop universities from feeding patent trolls like this. The project includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention/pledge&quot;&gt;Public Interest Patent Pledge&lt;/a&gt; for universities to sign stating that they will not sell their patents to trolls. We also drafted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention/legislation&quot;&gt;model state law&lt;/a&gt; to help ensure that state-funded universities don&#039;t sell their inventions to patent trolls. You can ask your university to sign the pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NAFTA Renegotiation Will Resurrect Failed TPP Proposals</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/nafta-renegotiation-will-resurrect-failed-tpp-proposals</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/30/white-house-calls-for-changing-but-not-scrapping-nafta-in-draft-letter/&quot;&gt;draft letter was leaked&lt;/a&gt; from acting USTR Stephen Vaughn to Congress on the Trump administration&#039;s intentions towards NAFTA. The letter describes the administration&#039;s intention to &quot;update&quot; NAFTA to include provisions on topics such as copyright and e-commerce that had been contained in the TPP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most chapters are clearly outdated and do not reflect the most recent standards in U.S. trade agreements. For example, digital trade was in its infancy in 1994. ... Rules for intellectual property rights, state-owned enterprises, rules of origin, customs procedures, and ensuring the benefits of trade benefit small and medium businesses have all been improved in newer trade agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On copyright, the letter promises to &quot;seek commitments from the NAFTA countries to strengthen their laws and procedures on enforcement of intellectual property rights, such as by ensuring that their authorities have authority to seize and destroy pirated and counterfeit goods, equipment used to make such goods, and documentary evidence.&quot; On e-commerce, it commits to tackling &quot;measures that impede digital trade in goods and services, restrict cross-border data flows, or require local storage or processing of data, including with respect to financial services&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are consistent with the wholesale transfer of TPP obligations into NAFTA, although they are annoyingly vague about what specific rules the U.S. will be including, other than the examples given. However it is worth noting that in at least one respect—the extension of the data localization ban to the financial industry—the letter proposes going &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; what was contained in the TPP. Exclusion of the financial services industry from those rules was one of the main sticking points with the TPP for Republicans while Obama was promoting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USTR letter also indicates that the administration intends to maintain the controversial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/leaked-tpp-investment-chapter-reveals-serious-threat-user-safeguards&quot;&gt;Investor-State Dispute Settlement&lt;/a&gt; (ISDS) provisions of NAFTA, which allowed pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly to sue Canada for the country&#039;s decision not to grant two drug patents. Although Canada recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/eli-lilly-loses-nafta-challenge-brought-against-canada&quot;&gt;won that case&lt;/a&gt;, the ability for foreign companies to challenge legislation and court decisions that go against their financial interests was one of the TPP&#039;s most controversial provisions, and will remain divisive as the NAFTA renegotiation goes forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Concern on E-Commerce Rules in Trade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news about Trump&#039;s plans for NAFTA coincides with EFF&#039;s workshop on electronic commerce rules in trade agreements at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightscon.org/&quot;&gt;RightsCon&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels today. (An introductory slide presentation from that workshop is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/31/e-commerce.pdf&quot;&gt;attached to this post&lt;/a&gt;.) One of several workshops on trade at the event, the panelists were united in their concern about the risks of new digital issues being addressed in trade agreements that are closed, opaque, and lobbyist-dominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelist Michael Geist pointed out that many e-commerce rules had formerly been dealt with in more open fora, and attempting to address then in trade agreements may result in rules that are flawed, weak, and inconsistent in their enforceability. While accepting that there are some digital rules that are relevant to global trade, panelist Meghan Sali from OpenMedia noted that &quot;The devil is in the details, and the details are kept secret&quot;, suggesting that a more open process would better reflect users&#039; priorities. Marília Maciel from DiploFoundation stressed the need to separate out the issues that are best dealt with in a trade context, from those that may be better dealt with by other, more specialist global institutions. Burcu Kilic from Public Citizen agreed, pointing out how viewing digital issues through a trade lens results in them being treated in a way that doesn&#039;t benefit users and developing countries. The final panelist, Maryant Fernández from European Digital Rights (EDRi), gave an example of the topic of data flows and data localization. Trade negotiators tend to see data protection rules as a trade restriction, rather than as legitimate measures to preserve the human right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion has a direct bearing on the future of NAFTA, presenting the U.S. with a choice either to focus its reforms on traditional trade issues that would directly impact the manufacturing sector, or to load the deal up with a grab bag of rules on unrelated digital policy issues, which is the approach that led to the implosion of the TPP. Although the administration has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-30/trump-backs-away-from-document-suggesting-softer-nafta-stance&quot;&gt;downplayed the significance&lt;/a&gt; of the leaked draft letter, it does give us an insight into a least some of the thinking that is going into the NAFTA renegotiation process. Since President Trump has been so scathing of the TPP and abandoned the deal with such fanfare, it would be disappointing if the new NAFTA were little more than a regurgitation of that failed agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Says No to So-Called “Moral Rights” Copyright Expansion</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eff-says-no-so-called-moral-rights-copyright-expansion</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the First Amendment and longstanding copyright limitations, copyright holders don’t have the legal right to prevent others from using their works to express messages that they disagree with or find offensive, nor do they have a right to prevent someone who lawfully purchases a copy of their work from reselling it, repurposing it, or destroying it entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because copyright law in the United States doesn’t provide authors the ability to launch lawsuits over their “moral rights” (except for some works of visual art covered by the Visual Artists Rights’ Act). And that’s a good thing – by limiting authors’ abilities to control how their works are used, U.S. copyright law creates space for downstream creators and users to adapt and remix existing works to create new interpretations and meanings, without facing a veto from the original author. It also allows those who own physical copies of copyrighted works to use those copies in the ways that make most sense for them – they can annotate them, take them apart and reassemble them into new creations, give them away, or even destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have fought for decades to improve copyright law to create more space for downstream uses, but the Copyright Office &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-23/pdf/2017-01294.pdf&quot;&gt;sought comments&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] on proposals that would do the exact opposite: creating a new right of integrity “to prevent prejudicial distortions of the work” and an unnecessary and potentially damaging attribution right (to be credited as the author).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight over moral rights, particularly the right of Integrity, is ultimately one about who gets to control the meaning of a particular work. If an author can prevent a use they perceive as a “prejudicial distortion” of their work, that author has the power to veto others’ attempts to contest, reinterpret, criticize, or draw new meanings from those works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of uses are paradigmatic fair uses, protected under traditional copyright law. But in countries that have adopted moral rights frameworks, authors (and their heirs) have the power to restrict certain uses or interpretations of their works that they disagree with. For example, as Peter Baldwin notes in his book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=7oOiAwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;dq=Peter+Baldwin+the+Copyright+Wars&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&quot;&gt;The Copyright Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;in France, George Bizet’s heirs succeeded in having Otto Preminger’s reinterpretation of the opera &lt;i&gt;Carmen, Carmen Jones,&lt;/i&gt; banned, because they objected to the filmmakers’ setting of the opera among African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, U.S. defamation law already provides remedies in appropriate cases when false, harmful statements are made about a person. If a work is used or falsely attributed in a way that causes real reputational harm to the author, defamation law provides the appropriate remedy. And, unlike a new right of integrity, defamation law contains safeguards designed to prevent the law from suppressing or punishing speech protected under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed attribution requirement presents lesser, but still significant harms, without adding much benefit. An additional right of attribution is likely to be redundant to existing rights under copyright law, which already provide copyright owners with broad powers to control dissemination of their works. With a right of attribution, copyright holders would have yet another tool to police otherwise non-infringing uses of a work, like fair uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fixed, statutory attribution right is also inconsistent with the rapid and diverse participatory cultural practices that prevail online. Cultural symbols are often rapidly reworked and shared, and norms around attribution vary dramatically across contexts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tushnet.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/fandombook.pdf&quot;&gt;Many creative communities have established norms regarding when and to what extent attribution is needed&lt;/a&gt; [PDF]. A rigid attribution requirement could disrupt these practices and impede valuable downstream creativity, while creating further opportunities for copyright trolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statutory right of attribution could also interfere with privacy protective measures employed by online platforms. Many platforms strip identifying metadata from works on their platforms to protect their users&#039; privacy, If doing so were to trigger liability for violating an author’s right of attribution, platforms would likely be chilled from protecting their users’ privacy in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, American courts have grappled with how to address harm to reputation without impinging on the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. And as copyright’s scope has expanded in recent decades, the courts have provided the safeguards that partially mitigate the harm of overly broad speech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we told the Copyright Office, introducing new rights to control the use and meaning of copyrighted works would be a step in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Report Aims to Help Criminal Defense Attorneys Challenge Secretive Government Hacking</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-report-aims-help-criminal-defense-attorneys-challenge-secretive-government</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers at EFF, the ACLU, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/report/challenging-government-hacking-criminal-cases?redirect=malware-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; today outlining strategies for challenging law enforcement hacking, a technique of secretly and remotely spying on computer users to gather evidence. Federal agents are increasingly using this surveillance technique, and the report will help those targeted by government malware—and importantly their attorneys—fight to keep illegally-obtained evidence out of court.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/rule-41-little-known-committee-proposes-grant-new-hacking-powers-government&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;change in little-known federal criminal court procedures,&lt;/a&gt; which was quietly pushed by the Justice Department, has enabled federal agents to use a single warrant to remotely search hundreds or thousands of computers without having to specify whose information is being captured or where they are. We expect these changes to result in much greater use of the technique, and the guide will arm attorneys with information necessary to defend their clients and ensure that law enforcement hacking complies with the Constitution and other laws.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the largest known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/illegal-playpen-story-rule-41-and-global-hacking-warrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government hacking campaign&lt;/a&gt; to date, the FBI seized servers running a website accused of hosting child pornography and, instead of shutting down the site, continued to operate it. Relying on a single &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/08/25/nit_warrant.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warrant,&lt;/a&gt; the FBI then hacked into users that accessed the site, totaling nearly 9,000 devices located in 120 countries around the world. The FBI charged hundreds of suspects who visited the website, several of whom are challenging the validity of the warrant. In briefs filed in these cases, EFF says that the warrant that enabled this massive hacking exercise is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/why-warrant-hack-playpen-case-was-unconstitutional-general-warrant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; and evidence gathered using it should be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every new surveillance power obtained by the government, it’s just a matter of time before these secret malware attacks are used in other cases. That’s why it’s important for criminal defense attorneys to get educated about how these attacks work and how they can vigorously defend their clients rights when the technique is used.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/report/challenging-government-hacking-criminal-cases?redirect=malware-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Challenging Government Hacking in Criminal Cases,”&lt;/a&gt; explains how to recognize the use of government malware in a criminal case, and it outlines the most important and potentially effective procedural and constitutional arguments to raise when hacking was used to gather evidence. Our hope is that the guide will help attorneys fight back against illegal surveillance, and ultimately place important and needed checks on the government’s ability to hack into our personal electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Most Powerful Single Click in Your Facebook Privacy Settings</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/most-powerful-single-click-your-facebook-privacy-settings</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Getting a new job, recovering from an abusive relationship, engaging in new kinds of activism, moving to a different country&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-909d2c8d-1aef-3388-057f-d504a541d39d&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;these are all examples of reasons one might decide to start using Facebook in a more private way. While it is relatively straightforward to change your social media use moving forward, it can be more complicated to adjust all the posts, photos, and videos you may have accumulated on your profile in the past. Individually changing the privacy settings for everything you have posted in the past can be impractical, particularly for very active users or those who have been using Facebook for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The good news is that Facebook offers a one-click privacy setting to retroactively change all your past posts to be visible to your friends only. With this tool, content on your timeline that you’ve shared to be visible to Friends of Friends or Public will change to be visible by Friends only. And the change will be “sticky”&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-909d2c8d-1aef-3388-057f-d504a541d39d&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it cannot be reversed in one click, and would be very difficult to accidentally undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Watch this video for a step-by-step tutorial to change this setting and make your posts more private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that, if you tagged someone else in a past post, that post will still be visible to them and to whatever audience they include in posts they are tagged in. And, if you shared a past post with a “custom” audience (like “Friends Except Acquaintances” or “Close Friends”), this setting won’t apply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Finally, this setting can only change the audience for posts that you have shared. When others tag you in their posts, then they control the audience. So share this blog post and video with your friends and encourage them to change their settings, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/data-privacy-day-play-privacy-team-sport&quot;&gt;privacy works best when we work together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Repealing Broadband Privacy Rules, Congress Sides with the Cable and Telephone Industry</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-sides-cable-and-telephone-industry</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting the interests of Internet providers over Internet users, Congress today voted to erase landmark broadband privacy protections. If the bill is signed into law, companies like Cox, Comcast, Time Warner, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon will have free rein to hijack your searches, sell your data, and hammer you with unwanted advertisements. Worst yet, consumers will now have to pay a privacy tax by relying on VPNs to safeguard their information. That is a poor substitute for legal protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, by a vote of 215 to 205 a slim majority of the House of Representatives have decided to give our personal information to an already highly profitable cable and telephone industry so that they can increase their profits with our data. The vote broke along party lines, with Republicans voting yes, although 15 Republicans broke ranks to vote against the repeal with the Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should President Donald Trump sign S.J. Res. 34 into law, big Internet providers will be given new powers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;harvest your personal information in extraordinarily creepy ways&lt;/a&gt;. They will watch your every action online and create highly personalized and sensitive profiles for the highest bidder. All without your consent. This breaks with the decades long legal tradition that your communications provider is never allowed to monetize your personal information without asking for your permission first. This will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules&quot;&gt;harm our cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; as these companies become giant repositories of personal data. It won&#039;t be long before the government begins demanding access to the treasure trove of private information Internet providers will collect and store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While today is extremely disappointing, there is still tomorrow. Without a doubt Internet providers (with the exception of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/small-isps-oppose-congressess-move-abolish-privacy-protections&quot;&gt; the small providers who stood with us&lt;/a&gt;) will engage in egregious practices, and we are committed to mobilizing the public to push back. EFF will continue the fight to restore our privacy rights on all fronts. We will fight to restore your privacy rights in the courts, in the states, in Washington, D.C., and with technology. We are prepared for the long haul of pushing a future Congress to reverse course and once again side with the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Join the fight for privacy and the open Internet.

    <title>Privacy By Practice, Not Just By Policy: A System Administrator Advocating for Student Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/privacy-practice-not-just-policy-system-administrator-advocating-student-privacy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/28/og-studentprivacygoogle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;When Matt L. started to raise the alarm about educational technology in his school district, he knew it would ruffle some feathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As a system administrator (or sysadmin), Matt has had a front-row seat to the increasing use of technology in his rural, public school district. At first, the district only issued Chromebooks to students in guest “kiosk” mode for test-taking. Over time, though, each of the district’s 10,000 students got individual access to school-issued devices, from iPads for younger students who cannot yet type to Chromebooks and G-Suite for Education logins for students as young as third grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Matt and his sysadmin colleagues are at the center of deploying, configuring, and maintaining Google devices and software for the entire district. This gives Matt opportunities to identify privacy problems with ed tech implementation, and to propose solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“All our eggs in one basket”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“I don’t want to say that Google or Chromebooks or any of this stuff is inherently bad,” Matt said. “Getting these tools into the hands of kids is hard to argue with. That’s why I got into technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As the district has continued to expand its technology use, however, Matt has started to have concerns about consolidating students’ educational and personal information in one company. “We’re putting all our eggs in one basket that we’re not in control of,” he said. “We don’t know where this student data is going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On top of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/student-privacy&quot;&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;, Matt observed students learning about only certain softwares without broader awareness of their technology choices. Having grown up experimenting with Linux and other open softwares, he was dismayed to see students being steered toward only Google services and away from other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The beauty of technology is that it is so vast and deep, with so many choices. But we’re funnelling people into one situation, which is not our job,” he said. “We should be teaching concepts of computing, not specific software. We should be giving parents and kids a choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Privacy by policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After frustrating initial conversations with colleagues, it became clear to Matt that student privacy advocacy in his district could “get touchy pretty quick.” Even higher-up colleagues who might have been in a position to make district-level changes were hard to effectively approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“They like Chrome because it’s easy to use and they don’t have to worry much about the mechanics behind it,” he said. “So, I was constantly ridiculed when I brought up concerns about privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Colleagues also pointed out the cost-effectiveness of free Google services in response to Matt’s concerns. But Matt was not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Nobody&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/school-librarian-caught-middle-student-privacy-extremes&quot;&gt;asking why it&#039;s free&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Matt said. “I thought it was common sense that, generally, if you&#039;re not paying for the app, you&#039;re the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After repeated requests to talk more about student privacy issues, Matt’s boss and members of administration pointed him to the district’s as well as Google’s privacy policies. But this approach of ensuring “privacy by policy” did not lessen Matt’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We have privacy policies for our website, and for our student academic records, but not so much for students’ information in regards to what Google is collecting,” he said. “We can’t guarantee what Google is or is not doing with this information. It’s all pretty vague, and it’s not the kind of thing you want to be vague about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One of the biggest problems with such “privacy by policy” is that it relies on all staff members being up-to-date on complex, sometimes vague policies, and having the time and resources to comply with them consistently. Matt observed that many in his district&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-909d2c8d-15bb-bcfc-72f4-1fce68a5acef&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;including his colleagues in system administration&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-909d2c8d-15bb-bcfc-72f4-1fce68a5acef&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;see student privacy as a long-term issue rather than an active, ongoing project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Stuff like student privacy gets back-burnered,” Matt said. “It’s hard to look down the road at long-term projects when teachers’ day-to-day is consuming all of our department’s time and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Privacy by practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Unsatisfied by the “privacy by policy” that his district usually practices, Matt is investigating how he can implement “privacy by practice”&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-909d2c8d-15bb-bcfc-72f4-1fce68a5acef&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;that is, prioritizing student privacy with active safeguards to augment and ensure existing policy, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/guide-chromebook-privacy-settings-students?from=student-privacy&quot;&gt;technical settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/fewer-resources-fewer-choices-school-administrator-indiana-works-protect-student?from=student-privacy&quot;&gt;opt-out options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;His first step has been to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/guide-google-account-privacy-settings-students?from=student-privacy&quot;&gt;“crank down the lid” on privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; so that students use Google products as anonymously as possible by default, without associating their online profiles with identifying information. Ideally, technical controls like these will make it harder for teachers or third-party companies to collect student data, making privacy the default in students’ and teachers’ work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He is also advocating for an opt-out policy. EFF helped Matt locate relevant examples of opt-out policies from other school districts to get conversations started. However, this advocacy process has brought up more questions than answers. Coworkers were concerned that giving students the option to opt out of Chromebooks and/or Google services will create more work for teachers and administrators, and it has been hard to build consensus around what classroom alternatives would be available when students choose to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Continuing to advocate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Matt’s conversations with colleagues have moved forward in fits and starts, and are constantly changing as the district’s technology situation changes. For example, a system-wide update gave Matt an opportunity to propose concurrent changes in ed tech implementation. But, soon after, discussions about abandoning local storage and migrating completely to Google Drive ran counter to Matt’s efforts to locally control student data and ensure their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Matt is thinking about stepping up student digital literacy education with more student-staff interactions on the topic. He has also brought up his concerns at professional conferences to learn from sysadmin in different schools and districts. Matt remains persistent and committed to advocating for more secure, more private student systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really hard problem, but we need to come up with an answer,” Matt said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s Make The Copyright Office Less Political, Not More</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/lets-make-copyright-office-less-political-not-more</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of discussing changes to copyright law, Congress’s first bill is a strange one. House and Senate Judiciary Committee leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/press-release/goodlatte-conyers-grassley-feinstein-leahy-call-quick-action-legislation-provide-selection-process-register-copyrights/&quot;&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would radically change the way the Register of Copyrights is picked – taking the process out of the hands of the Librarian of Congress and putting it into the hands of Congress and the President. That sounds like a pretty technical move, but it could have real consequences for future innovation and creativity.  Let’s break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, the Register is appointed by the Librarian of Congress, and serves under her direction and oversight.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SLW_502_xml.pdf?utm_source=House+Judiciary+Committee+Press+Releases&amp;amp;utm_campaign=0a41230351-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_03_23&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_df41eba8fd-0a41230351-101202693&quot;&gt;“Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017”&lt;/a&gt; would require that the head of the Copyright Office be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and would authorize the President to remove the Register. This would make the Register’s appointment process more democratic – but also more a captive of special interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Office is supposed to focus on a pretty mundane but important job: registering copyrightable works. Like the entities such as the Congressional Research Service and the GAO, the Copyright Office is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/701&quot;&gt;charged with&lt;/a&gt; providing advice to Congress, and “information and assistance” to other federal government entities.  It is not, however, responsible for making or officially applying copyright law except in very narrow circumstances (like deciding whether a work qualifies for registration). Instead, the responsibility for setting the nation’s copyright policy rests with Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, however, the Copyright Office has played an increasingly central role in policymaking – and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/captured-systemic-bias-at-the-us-copyright-office-1&quot;&gt;it has not been a neutral advocate&lt;/a&gt;. The Copyright Office has repeatedly put forward policy proposals and legal analyses that have tended to favor the interests of a particular segment of copyright owners (particularly major media and entertainment companies) over other constituencies. For example, one former Register famously stated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120330/09445718303/how-can-you-be-register-copyrights-if-you-dont-even-understand-copyrights-most-basic-purpose.shtml&quot;&gt;“[c]opyright is for the author first and the nation second.”&lt;/a&gt;  Under her leadership, the Office &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/the-growing-list-of-how-the-copyright-office-has-failed-us&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/a&gt; the disastrous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill&quot;&gt;Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)&lt;/a&gt;. And last year, the Office worked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/newly-released-documents-show-hollywood-influenced-copyright-offices-comments-set&quot;&gt;closely and quietly&lt;/a&gt; with major entertainment companies to derail the FCC’s effort to improve competition and consumer choice in cable set-top boxes. The Office also pushed through an unpopular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/11/copyright-office-sets-trap-unwary-website-owners&quot;&gt;rule change&lt;/a&gt; that puts many small website owners at risk of losing access to copyright law’s safe harbors for intermediaries. More and more people feel the consequences of this bias at the Copyright Office, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/another-loss-broadcast-tv-streaming-and-dangerous-shift-decision-making-power&quot;&gt;some appellate courts&lt;/a&gt; have looked to the Office to decide close and critical legal questions.  And thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/eff-librarian-congress-let-car-owners-look-under-hood&quot;&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Copyright Office also plays a central role in shaping our technological future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Register has gone from being a neutral expert to a political player. In theory, the bill would help mitigate this effect by making this Register &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;accountable to the public – after all, under the current regime the Register answers only to the Librarian of Congress. In practice, though, we fear it’s designed to do something else: allow powerful incumbent interests to use their lobbying power to control this increasingly politicized office.  No president is going to select an appointee that will be shot down by special interests. And while the Librarian of Congress still oversees the Copyright Office, the Librarian of Congress would not be able to remove the Register no matter how poorly they perform their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, we’ll have a Register, and a Copyright Office, that is accountable only to the President and the special interests that helped get them approved in the first place.  That will inevitably accelerate the politicization of the Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the current system, the official in charge of selecting the Register is a member of the one community that can usually be trusted to think about all of the interests copyright law affects: librarians.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/copyright-office-belongs-library&quot;&gt;As we’ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, libraries have an institutional obligation to serve the public, and to support access to knowledge and culture. Given copyright’s constitutional mandate to promote progress, we think the Office’s mission is best served when it is subject to the oversight and guidance of the library community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough that Congress and the public can no longer look to the Register as a neutral arbiter of copyright policy.  We shouldn’t make the problem worse by effectively making the Copyright Office into an independent regulator and policymaker. Instead, the Register should remain an advisor to Congress and an administrator of the registration system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California Bill To Ban “Fake News” Would Be Disastrous for Political Speech</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/california-bill-ban-fake-news-would-be-disastrous-political-speech</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (12:00 p.m., March 28, 2017): A.B. 1104 has been pulled and will not be heard in committee today. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to California Assemblymember Ed Chau: you can’t fight fake news with a bad law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the California Assembly’s Committee on Privacy and Consumer Affairs, which Chau chairs, will consider A.B. 1104—a censorship bill so obviously unconstitutional, we had to double check that it was real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1104&quot;&gt;It’s real. &lt;/a&gt; The proposed law reads: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;18320.5. It is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willingly make, publish or circulate on an Internet Web site, or cause to be made, published, or circulated in any writing posted on an Internet Web site, a false or deceptive statement designed to influence the vote on either of the following:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(a) Any issue submitted to voters at an election.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(b) Any candidate for election to public office.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action callout-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/protect-political-speech-online-stop-california-s-a-b-1104&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweet at the Assembly Privacy Committee now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it would be illegal to be wrong on the internet if it could impact an election. The bill is unconstitutional under U.S. Supreme Court case law (see our opposition letter for more information on that), and likely to draw immediate and costly lawsuits if it is signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Chau, A.B. 1104 is an attempt to address the issue of “fake news” that many believe plagued the 2016 election: websites publishing false stories and promoting them over social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No law, and certainly not A.B. 1104, will remedy this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American political speech dating back as far as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2016/08/james_callender_the_attack_dog_who_took_aim_at_alexander_hamilton_and_thomas.html&quot;&gt;John Adams-Thomas Jefferson rivalry&lt;/a&gt; has involved unfair smears, half and stretched truths, and even outright lies. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/&quot;&gt;During the 2016 campaign alone&lt;/a&gt;, PolitiFact ranked 202 statements made by President Donald Trump as mostly false or false statements and 63 “Pants on Fire” statements. Hillary Cllinton made 69 statements ranked mostly false or false and seven as “Pants on Fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill will fuel a chaotic free-for-all of mudslinging with candidates and others being accused of crimes at the slightest hint of hyperbole, exaggeration, poetic license, or common error. While those accusations may not ultimately hold up, politically motivated prosecutions—or the threat of such—may harm democracy more than if the issue had just been left alone. Furthermore, A.B. 1104 makes no exception for satire and parody, leaving The Onion and Saturday Night Live open to accusations of illegal content. Nor does it exempt news organizations who quote deceptive statements made by politicians in their online reporting—even if their reporting is meant to debunk those claims. And what of everyday citizens who are duped by misleading materials: if 1,000 Californians retweet an incorrect statement by a presidential candidate, have they all broken the law? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when political leaders are promoting “alternative facts” and branding unflattering reporting as “fake news,” we don’t think it’s a good idea to give the government more power to punish speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fight against lies, the government must not create the tools to suppress the truth.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/protect-political-speech-online-stop-california-s-a-b-1104&quot;&gt;Join us today in filling the committee&#039;s Twitter streams with our opposition to this bill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Small ISPs Oppose Congress&#039;s Move to Abolish Privacy Protections</title>

Many of them agree that we need the Federal Communication Commission&#039;s rules to protect our privacy online, and seventeen of them have written to Congress today to express their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation before the FCC’s intervention was succinctly described in the fine print of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20120324231449/http://www22.verizon.com:80/about/privacy/policy/#infoadv&quot;&gt;Verizon’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;:  “If you do not want information collected for marketing purposes from services such as the Verizon Wireless Mobile Internet services, you should not use those particular services.” That was refreshingly honest. Other ISPs including AT&amp;amp;T, Charter, and Sprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;also monitored their customers in intrusive ways&lt;/a&gt;, but were less frank in admitting it, even in their privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a letter signed by several small Internet providers who share our concerns. Add your voices to theirs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;call your Representative today and tell them not to repeal the broadband privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear U.S. Representatives,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Oppose S.J. Res 34 - Repeal of FCC Privacy Rules&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, the undersigned founders, executives, and employees of ISPs and networking companies, spend our working lives ensuring that Americans have high-quality, fast, reliable, and locally provided choices available when they need to connect to the Internet. One of the cornerstones of our businesses is respecting the privacy of our customers, and it is for that primary reason that we are writing to you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We urge Congress to preserve the FCC’s Broadband Privacy Rules and vote down plans to abolish them. If the rules are repealed, large ISPs across America would resume spying on their customers, selling their data, and denying them a practical and informed choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if there were a healthy, free, transparent, and competitive market for Internet services in this country, consumers could choose not to use those companies’ products. But small ISPs like ours face many structural obstacles, and many Americans have very limited choices: a monopoly or duopoly on the wireline side, and a highly consolidated cellular market dominated by the same wireline firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those circumstances, the FCC’s Broadband Privacy Rules are the only way that most Americans will retain the free market choice to browse the Web without being surveilled by the company they pay for an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Signed,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sonic &lt;br /&gt;Monkeybrains.net &lt;br /&gt;Cruzio Internet &lt;br /&gt;Etheric Networks &lt;br /&gt;University of Nebraska &lt;br /&gt;CREDO Mobile &lt;br /&gt;Aeneas Communications &lt;br /&gt;Digital Service Consultants Inc. &lt;br /&gt;Om Networks &lt;br /&gt;Hoyos Consulting LLC &lt;br /&gt;Mother Lode Internet &lt;br /&gt;Gold Rush Internet &lt;br /&gt;Ting Internet&lt;br /&gt;Tekify Fiber &amp;amp; Wireless&lt;br /&gt;Davis Community Network&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Buker (Director of Infrastructure Services &amp;amp; Research computing, University of Nebraska at Omaha) &lt;br /&gt;Tim Pozar (co-founder, TwoP LLC) &lt;br /&gt;Andrew Gallo (Senior Network Architect for a regional research and education network) &lt;br /&gt;Jim Deleskie (co-founder, Mimir networks) &lt;br /&gt;Randy Carpenter (VP, First Network Group) &lt;br /&gt;Kraig Beahn (CTO, Enguity Technology Corp)&lt;br /&gt;Chris Owen (President, Hubris Communications)&lt;br /&gt;James Persky (CEO, Pacific Internet)&lt;br /&gt;Brian Worthen, (CEO, Visionary Communications)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you run a small ISP and would like to join our letter, send an email to isp-letter@eff.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;action-center-widget&quot; href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy?nosignup=1&quot;&gt;Take part in the action!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Republicans in Congress Are Disregarding Their Own Privacy Policies </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/republicans-congress-are-disregarding-their-own-privacy-policies</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/27/flake_pp.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit Sen. Jeff Flake’s official website, scroll to the bottom, click “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;,” and you’ll find a page where the junior senator from Arizona makes this fine promise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am committed to protecting the personal privacy of individuals who use the Internet, including website visitors like you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action callout-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/offline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call your Congressmember&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to save online privacy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes onto say that “your privacy is important to me” and that you should “rest assured” that your data is safe with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet—last week Sen. Flake rushed a resolution through the Senate to repeal landmark privacy protections enacted by the Federal Communications Commission. The legislation would also bar the FCC from ever again acting to protect users’ data from internet providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the repeal, the companies that provide your broadband service—be it Comcast, Cox, Time Warner, AT&amp;amp;T, or Verizon—will be able to engage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;all sorts of underhanded ways to monetize your personal information&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll be allowed to collect your browsing history, hijack your search results, insert unwanted advertisements, and sell your data to marketers. In other words, if this repeal passes, no user should rest assured again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Flake isn’t the only senator to act in disregard of their stated commitments to privacy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy&quot;&gt;Forty-nine other Republicans joined him in the vote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/27/senators_-_yay.png&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these senators make similar statements in their privacy policies. For example, Sens. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/privacypolicy&quot;&gt;John Thune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heller.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;Dean Heller,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/privacypolicy&quot;&gt;Lamar Alexander&lt;/a&gt;’s Privacy Policies start:&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Protecting the personal privacy of individuals who use the Internet is a priority, and we appreciate the opportunity to describe to you the policies we have put in place to safeguard the privacy of individuals who visit our Web site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/content/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;Sen. John Cornyn’s Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Senator John Cornyn respects your right to privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to cornyn.senate.gov, and those who correspond with our offices via email.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/privacypolicy&quot;&gt;Sen. John Boozman’s&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Your privacy concerns are very important, so please know that we have safeguards in place to protect the privacy of visitors to my site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: if you’re a U.S. lawmaker, protecting privacy doesn’t just mean avoiding collecting their data when they visit your website. It means standing up for users’ rights every day on Capitol Hill—the exact opposite of which is to roll back the strong privacy protections already on the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the issue is before House of Representatives, which could vote on the resolution as early as Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;It’s important you call your lawmaker today to demand they vote down the repeal of the FCC privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their Senate colleagues, House Republicans also claim to respect user privacy. Speaker Paul Ryan’s Campaign site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ryanforcongress.com/privacy-policy/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that he knows “your right to privacy online is important.” Reps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://franks.house.gov/privacy&quot;&gt;Trent Franks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcclintock.house.gov/privacy&quot;&gt;Tom McClintock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://walters.house.gov/privacy&quot;&gt;Mimi Walters&lt;/a&gt;, and many others use this boilerplate language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We respect the privacy of our visitors and all those who come in contact with our office—be it in-person, through our Web site, or by mail, phone, or email. We therefore try to collect only such personal information as is needed to provide the information, service, or assistance that you request.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this just lip service? To truly respect the privacy of their constituents, these members need to not only limit what they collect but actively resist the telecommunication lobby’s play to collect and exploit our data. Otherwise, when you visit their sites, your internet provider will know it and be able to sell that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let your member of Congress get away with a personal data giveaway. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;Call them today &lt;/a&gt;and demand they vote down the repeal of the FCC’s privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> Urban Homesteaders Win Cancellation of Bogus Trademarks</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/urban-homesteaders-win-cancellation-bogus-trademarks</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Global Community Had Faced Baseless Legal Claims and Content Removal Threats&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco – Urban homesteaders can speak freely about their global movement for sustainable living, after convincing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel bogus trademarks for the terms “urban homesteading” and “urban homestead.” The authors and activists were represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and law firm of Winston &amp;amp; Strawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a victory for free speech and common sense. Threats over this trademark harmed us and the whole urban homesteading community—a group of people who are dedicated to sharing information about sustainable living online and elsewhere,” said Kelly Coyne, co-author with Erik Knutzen of The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City. “We are so pleased to have this issue settled at last, so we can concentrate on making urban life healthier and happier for anyone who wants to participate in this global effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Urban homesteading” has been used as a generic term for decades, describing activities like growing food, raising livestock, and producing simple food products at home. But a group called the Dervaes Institute managed to register “urban homesteading” and “urban homestead” as trademarks with the USPTO for “educational services” like blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing the trademarks, Dervaes got Facebook to take down content about urban homesteading, including pages that helped publicize Coyne and Knutzen’s book, as well as the Facebook page of a Denver farmer’s market. In 2011, EFF and Winston &amp;amp; Strawn petitioned the USPTO on behalf of Coyne, Knutzen, and book publisher Process Media, asking for the trademarks’ cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The words and phrases we use every day to describe basic activities should never be the exclusive property of a single person or business,” said EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry. “It took six years, but we’re proud that this terrible trademark is off the books.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t trademark generic terms and force ordinary conversations off the Internet,” said Winston &amp;amp; Strawn attorney Jennifer Golinveaux.  “We’re relieved that the urban homesteading community can continue sharing information about their important work without worrying about silly legal threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five Ways Cybersecurity Will Suffer If Congress Repeals the FCC Privacy Rules</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action callout-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/offline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call your Congressmember&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to save online privacy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in October of 2016, the Federal Communications Commission passed some pretty awesome rules that would bar your Internet provider from invading your privacy. The rules would keep Internet providers like Comcast and Time Warner Cable from doing things like selling your personal information to marketers, inserting undetectable tracking headers into your traffic, or recording your browsing history to build up a behavioral advertising profile on you—unless they got your permission first. The rules were a huge victory for U.S. Internet users who value their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last Thursday, Republicans in the Senate voted to repeal those rules. If the House of Representatives votes the same way and the rules are repealed, it’s pretty obvious that the results for Americans&#039; privacy will be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what many people don’t realize is that Americans’ cybersecurity is also at risk. That’s because privacy and security are two sides of the same coin: privacy is about controlling who has access to information about you, and security is how you maintain that control. You usually can’t break one without breaking the other, and that’s especially true in this context. To show how, here are five ways repealing the FCC’s privacy rules will weaken Americans’ cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risk #1: Snooping On Traffic (And Creating New Targets for Hackers)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for Internet providers to make money off your browsing history, they first have to collect that information—what sort of websites you’re browsing, metadata about whom you’re talking to, and maybe even what search terms you’re using. Internet providers will also need to store that information somewhere, in order to build up a targeted advertising profile of you. So where’s the cybersecurity risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first risk is that Internet providers haven’t exactly been bastions of security when it comes to keeping information about their customers safe. Back in 2015, Comcast had to pay $33 million for unintentionally releasing information about customers who had paid Comcast to keep their phone numbers unlisted. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/comcast-agrees-pay-33-million-data-breach-settlement-leaking-thousands-unlisted&quot;&gt;These customers ranged from domestic violence victims to law enforcement personnel&lt;/a&gt;”, many of who had paid for their numbers to be unlisted to protect their safety. But Comcast screwed up, and their phone numbers were published anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was just a mistake on Comcast’s part, with a simple piece of data like phone numbers. Imagine what could happen if hackers decided to target the treasure trove of personal information Internet providers start collecting. People’s personal browsing history and records of their location could easily become the target of foreign hackers who want to embarrass or blackmail politicians or celebrities. To make matters worse, FCC Chairman (and former Verizon lawyer) Ajit Pai recently halted the enforcement of a rule that would require Internet providers to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/isps-wont-have-to-follow-new-rule-that-protects-your-data-from-theft/&quot;&gt;take reasonable measures to protect customer [personal information] from unauthorized use, disclosure, or access&lt;/a&gt;”—so Internet providers won’t be on the hook if their lax security exposes your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would just be the fallout from passive data collection—where your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;simply spies on your data as it goes by. An even scarier risk is that&amp;nbsp;Internet providers want to be able to do much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risk #2: Erasing Encryption (And Making it Easier for Hackers to Spy On You)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;can only spy on the portion of your traffic that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; encrypted—in other words, whenever you visit a site that starts with http&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (instead of just http), your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; see the contents of what you’re browsing. They can still see what domain you’re visiting, but they can’t see what specific page, or what’s on that page. That frustrates a lot of&amp;nbsp;Internet providers, because they want to be able to build advertising profiles on the contents of your encrypted data as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to accomplish that,&amp;nbsp;Internet providers have proposed a standard (called Explicit Trusted Proxies) that would allow them to intercept your data, remove the encryption, read the data (and maybe even modify it), and then encrypt it again and send it on its way. At first blush this doesn’t sound so bad. After all, the data is only decrypted within the Internet provider’s servers, so hackers listening in on the outside still wouldn’t be able to read it, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-075A&quot;&gt;According to a recent alert&lt;/a&gt; by US-CERT, an organization dedicated to computer security within the Department of Homeland Security:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Many HTTPS inspection products do not properly verify the certificate chain of the server before re-encrypting and forwarding client data, allowing the possibility of a MiTM [Man-in-The-Middle] attack. Furthermore, certificate-chain verification errors are infrequently forwarded to the client, leading a client to believe that operations were performed as intended with the correct server.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/interception-ndss17.pdf&quot;&gt;a recent study found that 54% of connections that were intercepted (i.e. decrypted and re-encrypted) ended up with weaker encryption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translating from engineer-speak, that means many of the systems designed to decrypt and then re-encrypt data actually end up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itworld.com/article/3182431/security/some-https-inspection-tools-might-weaken-security.html&quot;&gt;weakening the security of the encryption&lt;/a&gt;, which exposes users to increased risk of cyberattack. Simply put, if&amp;nbsp;Internet providers think they can profit from looking at your encrypted data and start deploying these systems widely, we’ll no longer be able to trust the security of our web browsing—and that could end up exposing everything from your email to your banking information to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risk #3: Inserting Ads Into Your Browsing (And Opening Holes In Your Browsing Security)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the major threats to cybersecurity if the FCC’s privacy rules are repealed comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;Internet providers inserting ads into your web browsing&lt;/a&gt;. Here we’re talking about your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;placing additional ads in the webpages you view (beyond the ones that already exist). Why is this dangerous? Because inserting new code into a webpage in an automated fashion could break the security of the existing code in that page. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;security expert Dan Kaminsky put it&lt;/a&gt;, inserting ads could break “all sorts of stuff, in that you no longer know as a website developer precisely what code is running in browsers out there. You didn&#039;t send it, but your customers received it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, security features in sites and apps you use could be broken and hackers could take advantage of that—causing you to do anything from sending your username and password to them (while thinking it was going to the genuine website) to installing malware on your computer.&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref1_u1tbem5&quot; title=&quot;The mechanisms that can be broken by ad injection include: the Same Origin Policy; the correctness of non-browser applications that use HTTP as a transport mechanism (including many Internet of Things protocols, and software update mechanisms that rely on signatures but not TLS for security); certain uses of Content Security Policy headers.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote1_u1tbem5&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risk #4: Zombie Supercookies (Allowing Hackers to Track You Wherever You Go)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet providers haven’t been content with just inserting ads into our traffic—they’ve also tried inserting unique tracking tags as well (the way Verizon did two years ago). For&amp;nbsp;Internet providers, the motivation is to make you trackable, by inserting a unique ID number into every unencrypted connection your browser makes with a website. Then, a website that wants to know more about you (so they can decide what price to charge you for a product) can pay your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;a little money and tell them what ID number they want to know about, and your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;will share the desired info associated with that ID number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first you might be tempted to file this one away as purely a privacy problem. But this is a great example of how privacy and security really are two sides of the same coin. If your&amp;nbsp;Internet provider&amp;nbsp;is sending these tracking tags to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; website you visit (as Verizon did originally), then &lt;em&gt;every website you visit, and every third party embedded in websites you visit, can track you&lt;/em&gt;—even if you’ve deleted your browser’s cookies or enabled Incognito mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that more people will be able to track you as you surf the Web, you’ll see more creepy and disconcerting ads based on things you’ve done in the past, and many of the tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/which-apps-and-browsers-protect-you-against-verizon-and-turns-non-consensual&quot;&gt;you might use to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;won’t work because the tracking is being added after the data leaves your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risk #5: Spyware (Which Opens the Door for Malware)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last risk comes from&amp;nbsp;Internet providers pre-installing spyware on our devices—particularly on mobile phones, which most of us purchase directly from the company that provides our cell service, i.e. our&amp;nbsp;Internet provider. In the past,&amp;nbsp;Internet providers have installed spyware like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/carrier-iq-architecture&quot;&gt;Carrier IQ&lt;/a&gt; on phones, claiming it was only to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/12/carrier-iq-hit-with-privacy-lawsuits-as-more-security-researchers-weigh-in/&quot;&gt;improve wireless network and service performance.&lt;/a&gt;” After a huge blowback, many&amp;nbsp;Internet providers backed down on using Carrier IQ. But given that software like Carrier IQ could record what websites you visit and what search terms you enter, it would be pretty tempting for&amp;nbsp;Internet providers to resurrect that spyware and use it for advertising purposes. So where’s the cybersecurity risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/carrier-iq-architecture&quot;&gt;we’ve explained before&lt;/a&gt;, part of the problem with Carrier IQ was that it could be configured to record sensitive information into your phone’s system logs. But some apps transmit those logs off of your phone as part of standard debugging procedures, assuming there’s nothing sensitive in them. As a result, “keystrokes, text message content and other very sensitive information [was] in fact being transmitted from some phones on which Carrier IQ is installed to third parties.” Depending on how that information was transmitted, eavesdroppers could also intercept it—meaning hackers might be able to see your username or password, without having to do any real hacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the even bigger concern is that for spyware like Carrier IQ to function effectively, it has to have fairly low-level access to your phone’s systems—which is engineer-speak for saying it needs to be able to see and access all the parts of your phone’s operating system that would usually be secure. Thus, if hackers can find a vulnerability in the spyware, then they can use it as a sort of tunnel to get access to almost anything in your phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the cybersecurity implications of repealing the FCC’s privacy rules come from simple logic. If the privacy rules are repealed,&amp;nbsp;Internet providers will resume and accelerate these dangerous practices with the aim of monetizing their customers’ browsing history and app usage. But in order to do that,&amp;nbsp;Internet providers will need to record and store even more sensitive data on their customers, which will become a target for hackers.&amp;nbsp;Internet providers will also be incentivized to break their customers’ security, so they can see all the valuable encrypted data their customers send. And when&amp;nbsp;Internet providers break their customers’ security, you can be sure malicious hackers will be right on their heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net result is simple: repealing the FCC’s privacy rules won’t just be a disaster for Americans’ privacy. It will be a disaster for America’s cybersecurity, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy?nosignup=1&quot; class=&quot;action-center-widget&quot;&gt;Take part in the action!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are one vote away from a world where your ISP can track your every move online and sell that information to the highest bidder. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;Call your lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; now and tell them to protect federal online privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the FCC passed a set of rules for how ISPs deal with their customers’ data. The commonsense rules updated longstanding federal protections for Internet users. Under the rules, ISPs would be required to protect your data and wouldn’t be allowed to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;a host of creepy things&lt;/a&gt;, including sell your Internet browsing records without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those rules were a huge victory for consumers. Of course, the ISPs that stand to make money off of violating your privacy have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/three-myths-telecom-industry-using-convince-congress-repeal-fccs-privacy-rules&quot;&gt;lobbying Congress&lt;/a&gt; to repeal those rules. Unfortunately, their anti-consumer push has been working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy&quot;&gt;voted last week&lt;/a&gt; 50-48 on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to repeal the FCC’s privacy rules. Now the resolution heads over the House, where it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-debates-reversing-course-decades-consumer-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to get a vote on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the House passes it, you’ll be even more at the mercy of your ISP. Because Congress is using a CRA resolution, the FCC will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/congress-contemplating-making-it-illegal-protect-consumer-privacy-online&quot;&gt;prohibited&lt;/a&gt; from writing similar rules in the future. And thanks to the current legal landscape, no other federal agency has the authority to protect you against privacy invasions by your ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a House vote scheduled for Tuesday, we have 24 hours to speak up and tell our representatives that they can’t put ISPs’ profits over our privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call your lawmakers today and tell them to oppose S.J. Res. 34, which would repeal the FCC’s broadband privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Launches Community Security Training Series</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eff-launches-community-security-training-series</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFF is pleased to announce a series of community security trainings in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfpl.org&quot;&gt;San Francisco Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. High-profile data breaches and hard-fought battles against unlawful mass surveillance programs underscore that the public needs practical information about online security. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/hey-cia-you-held-security-flaw-information-now-its-out-thats-not-how-it-should&quot;&gt;We know more about potential threats&lt;/a&gt; each day, but we also know that encryption works and can help thwart digital spying. Lack of knowledge about best practices puts individuals at risk, so EFF will bring lessons from its comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org&quot;&gt;Surveillance Self-Defense guide&lt;/a&gt; to the SFPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF has tailored this series for technology beginners who may be unaware of potential privacy dangers, but already use smart phones or computers. Library patrons are invited to bring their devices to EFF&#039;s introductory classes which include discussions of basic online security concepts and privacy tools. &lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-549e53e4-ed72-102d-039d-00293980b696&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/about/staff/lisa-wright&quot; class=&quot;eff-red&quot;&gt;Lisa Wright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/about/staff/william-theaker&quot; class=&quot;eff-red&quot;&gt;Willie Theaker&lt;/a&gt;, members of EFF&#039;s TechOps Team, will facilitate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Digital Privacy and Security: A Beginner-to-Intermediate Workshop&lt;/em&gt; followed by &lt;em&gt;Encryption Apps for your Phone: An Intermediate Workshop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-549e53e4-ed72-102d-039d-00293980b696&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; There will be two opportunities to attend each class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/digital-privacy-and-security-beginner-intermediate-workshop&quot;&gt;Digital Privacy and Security: A Beginner-to-Intermediate Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tuesday, March 28, 2017&lt;br /&gt;
6:00 pm to 7:30 pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/encryption-apps-your-phone-intermediate-workshop&quot;&gt;Encryption Apps for your Phone: An Intermediate Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tuesday, April 4, 2017&lt;br /&gt;
6:00 pm to 7:30 pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/digital-privacy-and-security-beginner-intermediate-workshop-0&quot;&gt;Digital Privacy and Security: A Beginner-to-Intermediate Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/encryption-apps-your-phone-intermediate-workshop-0&quot;&gt;Encryption Apps for your Phone: An Intermediate Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tuesday, April 18, 2017&lt;br /&gt;
6:00 pm to 7:30 pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Event details are included in each link to the EFF calendar above. Space is limited and attendance is on a first-come, first-served basis so attendees should prepare to arrive early. We encourage all EFF supporters to help people in their circles learn more about online rights issues and how to keep themselves—and each other— safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of April, EFF&#039;s spring Bay Area Members&#039; Speakeasy will feature a more advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-public-key-cryptography-and-pgp&quot;&gt;workshop on email encryption and key generation&lt;/a&gt; open to EFF members and their guests—we encourage you to bring a friend! Following the workshop, all EFF members will be invited to join our PGP keysigning party to help bring the community together and further expand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-public-key-cryptography-and-pgp#4&quot;&gt;web of trust&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a current Bay Area member accepting email, you will receive a personal invitation including event details. Not a member yet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/speakeasy&quot;&gt;Join today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Surveillance Self-Defense project and these local events, EFF strives to help make information about online security accessible to beginners as well as seasoned techno-activists and journalists. We hope you will consider our tips on how to protect your digital privacy, but we also hope you will encourage those around you to learn more and make better choices with technology. After all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/data-privacy-day-play-privacy-team-sport&quot;&gt;privacy is a team sport&lt;/a&gt; and everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another Loss For Broadcast TV Streaming, And A Dangerous Shift Of Decision-Making Power</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/another-loss-broadcast-tv-streaming-and-dangerous-shift-decision-making-power</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another court has ruled that streaming local broadcast TV channels to mobile devices is something that only traditional pay-TV companies can do—startups need not apply. The Ninth Circuit appeals court has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/fox-television-stations-v-aereokiller-ninth-circuit-opinion&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that FilmOn, an Internet video service, cannot use the license created by Congress for “secondary transmissions” of over-the-air TV broadcasts. That likely means that FilmOn and other Internet-based services won’t be able to stream broadcast TV at all. That’s a setback for local TV and the news, weather, local advertising, and community programming it carries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court’s harmful ruling is bad enough, and is made worse by the way it arrived at that decision. Instead of interpreting the Copyright Act according to its own independent judgment, the court deferred to the opinion of the Register of Copyrights, an official who has no authority to make or interpret laws on her own. And the Register has often acted as more of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/captured-systemic-bias-at-the-us-copyright-office-1&quot;&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt; for the media and entertainment industries than a neutral authority. Ms. Pallante, the former Register, famously said that “copyright is for the author first and the nation second,” and has gone on to become the head of a trade association for publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can startups take advantage of the law that allows incumbent pay-TV services to carry broadcast TV?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/filmon-can-use-cable-systems-copyright-license-stream-broadcast-tv&quot;&gt;fight&lt;/a&gt; to send broadcast TV over the Internet has been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/wnet-v-aereo&quot;&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; one. For most people in the U.S., it’s hard if not impossible to watch local TV stations live over the Internet. Unlike other forms of video programming that are available in many different ways, local broadcasts usually require a TV set and a finicky antenna or an expensive cable subscription. Of course, the technology to send local broadcast TV to Internet-connected devices has been around for a while. Copyright law, not technology, has been the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright applies when shows are transmitted “to the public.” That means cable operators need licenses from copyright holders. And since the Supreme Court’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aereo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;decision, Internet-based services that “look like cable” to the customer also need licenses. The major difficulty is that the programs, commercials, and other material shown on TV channels have many different copyright holders. A service that wants to help viewers see those channels in more places and on more devices is faced with the difficult (in fact, often impossible) task of negotiating a license with each and every one of those owners &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; their material goes on the air. Fail to license even a single program or commercial and the would-be cable competitor risks lawsuits and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/collateral-damages-why-congress-needs-fix-copyright-laws-civil-penalties&quot;&gt;ruinous copyright penalties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But copyright law also includes a way for pay-tv systems to get the permissions they need by paying a set fee. That mechanism, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#111&quot;&gt;Section 111&lt;/a&gt;, applies to any “facility” that “receives signals” from broadcast TV stations and “makes secondary transmissions” of those signals to paying subscribers. The law was passed long before Internet video streaming, but its core definition of a “cable system” is written broadly enough to include an Internet-based system like FilmOn’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nope, because that law is unclear and the Register of Copyrights said it shouldn’t apply.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major TV and movie studios have long opposed letting Internet-based services use the Section 111 license, and so did Maria Pallante, who was the Register of Copyrights (the head of the Copyright Office) until 2016. She wrote several letters and papers arguing that only traditional cable systems should be able to use the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the studios’ case against FilmOn, one of several they filed around the country, the federal district court in Los Angeles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/filmon-can-use-cable-systems-copyright-license-stream-broadcast-tv&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Congress wrote Section 111 broadly enough to include Internet-based services. This week, the Ninth Circuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/fox-television-stations-v-aereokiller-ninth-circuit-opinion&quot;&gt;reversed &lt;/a&gt;that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court recognized that applying a complex 41-year-old law to today’s technology is not straightforward: “FilmOn and other Internet-based retransmission services are neither clearly eligible nor clearly ineligible for the compulsory license [Section] 111 makes available to ‘cable systems.’” At this point, the court could have grappled with the purposes of the law, its legislative history, and its effects on the TV market to reach a result. But it didn’t do this in any significant way. Instead, it “deferred” to the Register of Copyrights and treated her opinions on this question as the final word. The judges wrote that the Copyright Office “has a much more intimate relationship with Congress and is institutionally better equipped than we are to sift through and to make sense of the fact and heterogeneous expanse that is the [Copyright] Act’s legislative history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a troubling conclusion. While the Copyright Office staff might be more familiar with this area of law than a federal judge, the Office doesn’t have the authority to make or interpret laws. Treating the Register of Copyrights’ opinions about the law as binding invades both Congress’s power to make laws and the courts’ role as interpreters of the law. While the Copyright Office serves important functions, including registering copyrights and keeping records of them, and growing the Library of Congress’s collection, it shouldn’t be given the powers of a court to issue binding interpretations of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision leaves streaming services for broadcast TV in a double bind: they &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to get permission from rightsholders, but they &lt;i&gt;can’t&lt;/i&gt; get that permission using the streamlined method that Congress created. In practical terms, that means traditional pay-TV systems can retransmit broadcast TV to paying subscribers, but newer competitors that use streaming can’t. Protected against competition from streaming technology, cable subscription prices continue to climb, and broadcast TV continues to diminish as a source of local information and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-related-cases field-type-node-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Related Cases:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cases/wnet-v-aereo&quot;&gt;WNET v.

Laying the blame for falling revenues on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook (despite that fact that revenues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/its-same-old-song-big-content-pushes-expanded-copyright-powers&quot;&gt;aren&#039;t actually falling at all&lt;/a&gt;), their aim is to impose new controls over how these platforms allow you to access and share content online. The control at the top of their wish-list is a compulsory upload filter, that would automatically screen everything that you upload. Such a requirement would be a costly imposition on smaller platforms and new innovators, and provide governments with a ready-built infrastructure for content censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the situation is a little different—because due to an oversight in implementation of the original U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement in 2005, they never had a copyright safe harbor system to begin with; or rather, a much narrower one which only applies to ISPs, but not to other Internet platforms, nor even to other Internet access providers such as libraries and educational institutions. This oversight was due to be remedied with the passage of new amendments to Australia&#039;s Copyright Act. (The TPP, had it passed, would also have required Australia to bring in this reform.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately pressure from copyright holders, including a well-orchestrated &lt;a href=&quot;http://changedmylife.com.au/&quot;&gt;astroturf campaign&lt;/a&gt;, put the kibosh on that this week, when the safe harbor reforms were dropped from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5832&quot;&gt;copyright amendment Bill&lt;/a&gt;. What does this mean in practice? Essentially it translates into a huge potential legal liability for Internet platforms that allow users to upload content. Because they don&#039;t have any protection from liability for user content that infringes copyright, there is the risk that their services could be characterised by a court as inducing or contributing to copyright infringement, much in the same way that file sharing software was accused of doing so in a rash of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/riaa-v-people-five-years-later&quot;&gt;U.S. lawsuits in the early 2000s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of that file sharing software was driven into extinction, the same fate did not befall America&#039;s user generated content websites. This wasn&#039;t for lack of trying by Big Media. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/viacom-v-youtube&quot;&gt;Viacom v. Youtube&lt;/a&gt; case, they argued that YouTube was liable for copyright infringements in the videos that its users uploaded. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca&quot;&gt;DMCA safe harbor&lt;/a&gt; Viacom lost the case (though an appeal was later settled), and to this day websites in the U.S. remain entitled to allow users to upload content of their choice, without taking on advance responsibility for the copyright status of that content. Instead, if a copyright infringement is alleged, the copyright holder issues a takedown notice to the website, which will remove it and leave the next steps up to the user and the copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, a similar case might be decided differently, and content sharing platforms could be shut down in the absence of an adequate safe harbor protection. This leaves platforms with the stark choice to run the risk of being required to pay enormous penalties to copyright holders, or preemptively enter into agreements with copyright holders to pay license fees for all user uploaded content, or exit the Australian market altogether. In short, Australian online innovators face a lot more risk and uncertainty for as long as they lack adequate copyright safe harbor protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia had the opportunity to bring its laws into line with equivalent laws from the U.S. and Europe, and international standards as encapsulated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manilaprinciples.org&quot;&gt;Manila Principles on Intermediary Liability&lt;/a&gt;. This week, it squandered that opportunity by sending the proposal back to the drawing board, and it&#039;s Australian innovators, libraries, educational institutions, and their users who will suffer. We urge the Australian government to look beyond the copyright lobby to the broad sectors of Australian society who have expressed support for this important reform, and to reintroduce it at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House Schedules Vote on Eliminating Consumer Online Privacy Rights Next Week</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-debates-reversing-course-decades-consumer-privacy-protections</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Majority Leader McCarthy Confirms House to Immediately Act on Behalf of the Cable and Telephone Industry Following the Senate Vote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the U.S. Senate by a razor thin margin of 50 to 48 voted to take away the privacy rights of Internet users as a favor to the cable and telephone industry. Now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tech/2017/03/house-to-vote-on-broadband-privacy-cra-next-week-219411&quot;&gt;House is planning to take up the legislation immediately next week&lt;/a&gt; before people can discover the damage they are about to inflict to consumer privacy online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These Are Our Legal Rights To Privacy They Are Dismantling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans have enjoyed a legal right to privacy from your communications provider under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/three-myths-telecom-industry-using-convince-congress-repeal-fccs-privacy-rules&quot;&gt;Section 222 of the Telecommunications Act&lt;/a&gt; for more than twenty years. When Congress made that law, it had a straightforward vision in how it wanted the dominate communications network (at that time the telephone company) to treat your data, recognizing that you are forced to share personal information in order to utilize the service and did not have workable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;action-center-widget&quot; href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy?nosignup=1&quot;&gt;Take part in the action!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Congress has begun to reverse course by eliminating your communication privacy protections in order to open the door for the cable and telephone industry to aggressively monetize your personal information. Proponents of such a drastic course change in law would have you believe that a repeal of the Federal Communications Commission&#039;s updated privacy rules for broadband providers would still leave your privacy protections intact. This understates the gravity of what H.J. Res. 86 and S.J. Res 34 may do to consumer privacy. Make no mistake, if Congress decides to codify a repeal of consumer privacy under the Congressional Review Act (as opposed to simply amending the law or the FCC changing the privacy rules again), it can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/congress-contemplating-making-it-illegal-protect-consumer-privacy-online&quot;&gt;a serious impact on your legal right to privacy in your communications over broadband.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of eliminating consumer privacy will go even further and say that it is the FCC&#039;s fault that they must harm the legal protections you have enjoyed for more than twenty years by stating it was the agency that overreached its legal authority and acted in a manner that was unconnected with the law. But when Congress actually wrote the law, the charge it gave the FCC seemed fairly clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/104/crpt/srpt23/CRPT-104srpt23.pdf&quot;&gt;The Senate Commerce Committee,&lt;/a&gt; for example, expressed a clear intent of specific legal obligations for the communications provider by stating the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“In general, a Bell company may not share with anyone customer-specific proprietary information without the consent of the person to whom it relates. Exceptions to this general rule permit disclosure in response to a court order or to initiate, render, bill and collect for telecommunications services.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House Commerce Committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/104/crpt/hrpt204/CRPT-104hrpt204-pt1.pdf&quot;&gt;in their own report indicated a similar line of thinking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“This section defines three fundamental principles to protect all consumers. These principles are: (1) the right of consumers to know the specific information that is being collected about them; (2) the right of consumers to have proper notice that such information is being used for other purposes; and (3) the right of consumers to stop the reuse or sale of that information.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the FCC has done the job Congress told it to do many years ago. However, the cable and telephone industry have sensed an opportunity to exploit the flurry of repeals Congress has taken up and laid out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/three-myths-telecom-industry-using-convince-congress-repeal-fccs-privacy-rules&quot;&gt;series of misleading arguments to convince Congress to proactively do harm to your privacy&lt;/a&gt;. They were successful at convincing 50 U.S. Senators to go along with their plan. Now the fight has moved to the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is only one way to stop them from winning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must speak up and &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;call our elected officials&lt;/a&gt; to reject H.J. Res 86 and S.J. Res 34 and preserve our legal rights to consumer online privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate Puts ISP Profits Over Your Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate just voted to roll back your online privacy protections. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;Speak up now&lt;/a&gt; to keep the House from doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;action-center-widget&quot; href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy?nosignup=1&quot;&gt;Take part in the action!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISPs have been lobbying for weeks to get lawmakers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;repeal the FCC’s rules&lt;/a&gt; that stand between them and using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;even creepier ways&lt;/a&gt; to track and profit off of your every move online. Republicans in the Senate just voted 50-48 (with two absent votes) to approve a Congressional Review Action resolution from Sen. Jeff Flake which—if it makes it through the House—would not only roll back the FCC’s rules but also prevent the FCC from writing similar rules in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;That would be a crushing loss for online privacy. ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldn’t be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can still kill this in the House:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;call your lawmakers today&lt;/a&gt; and tell them to protect your privacy from your ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Bill of Rights at The Border: The First Amendment and the Right to Anonymous Speech</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/bill-rights-border-first-amendment-and-right-anonymous-speech</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. border has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-immigration-detention-deportations-enforcement/&quot;&gt;thrown into the spotlight&lt;/a&gt; these last few months, with border agents detaining travelers for hours, demanding travelers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-citizens-u-s-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone-n732746&quot;&gt;unlock devices&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/border-agents-personal-information/517962/&quot;&gt;demanding passwords&lt;/a&gt; and social media handles as a prerequisite for certain travelers entering the country. As the U.S. government issues a dizzying array of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-laptop-ban-adds-travelers-lack-privacy-and-security&quot;&gt;new rules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-ban-laptops-tablets-electronics-flights-middle-eastern-countries/&quot;&gt;regulations&lt;/a&gt;, people in the U.S. and abroad are asking: are there meaningful constitutional limits on the ability of border agents to seize and search the data on your electronic devices and in the cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is: Yes. As we’ll explain in a series of posts on the Bill of Rights at the border and discuss in detail in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/10/digital-privacy-border-2017-guide3.10.17.pdf&quot;&gt;border search guide&lt;/a&gt;, border agents and their activities are not exempt from constitutional scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first post, we’ll focus on the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment is meant to safeguard five fundamental rights: speech, assembly, religion, press, and petition to the government for redress of grievances. The First Amendment also protects the right to exercise these basic rights anonymously because, as Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/334/case.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity&quot;&gt;Anonymity&lt;/a&gt; is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when border agents scrutinize the massive volume of sensitive information in our digital devices or in the cloud, they infringe on First Amendment rights in at least four distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, device searches may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/08/border-security-facebook-password-trump-travel-ban&quot;&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt; your &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/02/08/social-media-at-the-border-can-agents-ask-for-your-facebook-feed/&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; profile handles –  inclusive of pseudonymous accounts. This allows border agents to match those handles to your passport identity, which effectively unmasks you and prevents you from being able to speak anonymously online. The same is true if you comply with an agent’s demand that you tell them your social media handles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second, device searches may also chill your ability to &lt;i&gt;associate&lt;/i&gt; with an expressive institution anonymously, like a political group. Border agents can use a device search or knowledge of your social media handles to unearth a variety of private associational ties that can be mapped and harvested for more personal information and connections. What is worse, the investigation may intrude upon your contacts’ privacy as well as your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Third, requiring you to let CBP review your web-browsing history violates your right to &lt;i&gt;access and receive information&lt;/i&gt; anonymously. This intrusion also occurs when CBP scrutinizes your shopping histories to reveal your private decisions to acquire expressive materials, such as books and movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, requiring journalists to unlock devices that contain confidential journalistic sources and work product inhibits their ability to &lt;i&gt;shield the identity of their sources&lt;/i&gt; and undermines the integrity and independence of the newsgathering process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border searches of our digital devices and cloud data thus implicate core free speech rights. Therefore, border agents should at least be required to obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before any such search of our private digital information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the First Amendment requires even more. For example, when police officers demand purchasing records from booksellers (implicating the right to access information anonymously), the First Amendment requires not only probable cause, but a &lt;a href=&quot;http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/supreme-court/2002/01sa205-0.html&quot;&gt;compelling need&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/205/case.html&quot;&gt;exhaustion of less restrictive&lt;/a&gt; investigative methods, and a substantial nexus between the information sought and the investigation. Given that a digital device search is far more invasive upon First Amendment rights than disclosure of what books a person buys at a single bookseller, border agents should be required to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the government should take special care with respect to journalists. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2008-title42/pdf/USCODE-2008-title42-chap21A-subchapI.pdf&quot;&gt;Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; prohibits the government from searching or seizing a journalist’s materials without probable cause that the journalist has &lt;i&gt;committed a crime&lt;/i&gt;. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000aa-5&quot;&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; exempts border searches for the purpose of enforcing the&lt;i&gt; customs&lt;/i&gt; laws, it does not exempt border searches for other purposes, such as a criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, so far, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020140102741/ABIDOR%20v.%20NAPOLITANO&quot;&gt;courts&lt;/a&gt; have refused to recognize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/393/393.F3d.501.03-4907.html&quot;&gt;free speech implications&lt;/a&gt; of digital border searches. But we hope and expect that will change as courts are forced to weigh the increasing amount of sensitive information easily accessible on our devices and in the cloud, and the increasing frequency and scope of border searches of this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without First Amendment protections at the border, the threat of self-censorship looms large. Travelers faced with the risk of border agent intrusion into such sensitive data are more prone to self-censorship when expressing themselves, when considering private membership in political groups, or when deciding whether to access certain reading or media material. This is especially true for people who belong to unpopular groups, who espouse unpopular opinions, or who read unpopular books or view unpopular movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, confidential sources that provide invaluable information to the public about government or corporate malfeasance may refrain from whistleblowing if they fear journalists cannot protect their identities during border crossings. &lt;span class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;This is why EFF is calling for stronger Constitutional protection of your digital information and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/demand-border-agents-get-a-warrant-before-digital-searches&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;urging people to contact Congress on this issue today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;callout-right&quot;&gt;We’re also collecting stories of border search abuses at: borders@eff.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is there’s a lot you can do at the border to protect your digital privacy. Take the time to review our pocket guides on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/digital-privacy-us-border&quot;&gt;Knowing Your Rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/08/border-guide.pdf&quot;&gt;Protecting your Digital Data&lt;/a&gt; at the border.

    <title>Call Your Senators Thursday Morning to Save Your Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/call-your-senators-thursday-morning-protect-your-privacy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress is getting serious about taking away your online privacy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;We have to get serious about stopping them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate is going to vote on Thursday on a measure from Sen. Jeff Flake that would repeal the broadband privacy rules passed by the FCC last year. According to at least one of the measure’s co-sponsors, it will &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amir_anasr/status/844258989214982146&quot;&gt;likely have the votes it needs&lt;/a&gt; to pass in the Senate unless we &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;take action right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those rules were a huge win for consumers, and—if Congress doesn’t get in the way—they’ll protect Internet users from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;creepy tracking by their ISPs&lt;/a&gt; when they go into effect later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve argued, repealing the FCC’s privacy rules is a bad move for consumers. If Congress repeals the rules, your ISP will be able to sell records about what you look at, what you purchase, and who you talk to online. The FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/congress-contemplating-making-it-illegal-protect-consumer-privacy-online&quot;&gt;may not be able&lt;/a&gt; to write new privacy rules, and, because of the current legal landscape, it’s not clear that any federal agency would be able to step in and protect consumers when ISPs violate their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to act. &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;Call your lawmakers and tell them to oppose the resolution to repeal the FCC’s privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Know About Digital Devices Searches in California Schools? Send a Report to EFF. </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/know-about-digital-devices-searches-california-schools-send-report-eff</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in California, we’re in a tough battle over how and when the government can search through the digital devices of teachers and students. A terrible proposal—&lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB165&quot;&gt;A.B. 165&lt;/a&gt;—seeks to strip over 6-million Californians of privacy safeguards baked into our state laws, giving the government a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/dangerous-california-bill-would-leave-students-and-teachers-vulnerable-warrantless&quot;&gt;loophole&lt;/a&gt; to rifle through personal digital devices in schools without a warrant issued by a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for individuals in California’s public schools who can report on experiences with digital device searches. Are you a student who had a school administrator search your device without your consent? Are you a parent whose son or daughter was punished because of data found on their device? Are you a teacher who has seen or been part of questionable searches in the school context? We want to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of stories that would be especially useful for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples in which digital device searches may have violated existing California law and resulted in negative consequences (embarrassment, administrative action, criminal investigation) for students or teachers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples in which digital device searches in schools exposed sensitive details about students, teachers, or their families, including medical concerns; immigration status, economic status, sexual orientation, or political speech;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other examples of digital devices searches in California schools that you found concerning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please report stories &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/student-digital-device-survey&quot;&gt;using our survey&lt;/a&gt; and share this request with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.B. 165 is currently scheduled for a hearing before the Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection on April 18. That means that right now is a very important time to make sure all our California legislators hear us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10472&quot;&gt;Please speak out now against A.B. 165&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10472&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10472&quot;&gt;Speak out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in California? You can still make a difference. Please reach out to your friends in California and ask them to speak out, and please share this blog post on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/dangerous-california-bill-would-leave-students-and-teachers-vulnerable-warrantless&quot;&gt;Read more about how A.B. 165 will impact privacy in California and could be the first step toward rolling back privacy protections for other communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consumers Press the USTR Nominee on Trade Transparency</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/consumers-press-ustr-nominee-trade-transparency</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) nominee Robert Lighthizer takes office, he’s already feeling the heat from Congress and from public interest representatives about improving transparency and public access to trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In written answers given as part of Lighthizer’s confirmation hearing last week, Senator Ron Wyden asked him, “What specific steps will you take to improve transparency and consultations with the public?”. Lighthizer’s reply (which he repeated in similar form in response to similar questions from other Senators) was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, I will ensure that USTR follows the TPA [Trade Promotion Authority, aka. Fast Track] requirements related to transparency in any potential trade agreement negotiation. I will also look forward to discussing with you ways to ensure that USTR fully understands and takes into account the views of a broad cross-section of stakeholders, including labor, environmental organizations, and public health groups, during the course of any trade negotiation. My view is that we can do more in this area to ensure that as we formulate and execute our trade policy, we receive fulsome input and have a broad and vigorous dialogue with the full range of stakeholders in our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Maria Cantwell sought to drill down into more specifics, by having Lighthizer address the skewed Trade Advisory Committees that currently advise the USTR. In response to her question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree that it is problematic for a select group of primarily corporate elites to have special access to shape US trade proposals that are not generally available to American workers and those impacted by our flawed trade deals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighthizer replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that USTR’s Trade Advisory Committees represent all types of stakeholders to ensure that USTR benefits fully from a diverse set of viewpoints in considering the positions it takes in negotiations. If confirmed, I will work to ensure that USTR’s Trade Advisory Committees are appropriately constituted in order to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell also invited Lighthizer to commit to replacing the advisory system with a new process that invites the American public to help shape U.S. proposals for trade agreements and give input on negotiated texts, as well as to having all proposals and negotiated texts published online in a timely fashion so the workers and the broader public that will be impacted by these agreements have a full understanding of what is being negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to do so, going only so far as to say that he would look forward to discussing “additional means for ensuring public input into U.S. trade negotiations”, as well as “ways to ensure that USTR fully understands and takes into account the views of all stakeholders during the course of a trade negotiation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rather vague commitment certainly doesn’t close the door on the administration adopting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/does-trumps-withdrawal-tpp-signal-new-approach-trade-agreements&quot;&gt;kind of reforms&lt;/a&gt; that EFF has demanded, but it also suggests that we will have to continue fighting hard for them to avoid yet another cop-out by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trans-Atlantic Consumer Groups Speak Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we’re not alone in that fight. EFF has just returned from the annual public forum of the Trans-Atlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD), a forum of U.S. and European consumer groups, of which we are a member. This diverse group released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tacd.org/tacd-launches-vision-for-a-positive-consumer-agenda-new-rules-for-the-global-economy/&quot;&gt;Positive Consumer Agenda&lt;/a&gt; for trade which includes the following demands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any regulatory cooperation dialogue and trade negotiation must be transparent. Agendas of the meetings and rounds must be made publicly available well in advance as well as negotiating documents and minutes of meetings and rounds. For trade negotiations, negotiations should not begin until all parties agree to publish their textual proposals as well as consolidated negotiating texts after each round on publicly available websites. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US positions on trade deals can be formulated the way other US federal regulations are: through an on-the-record public process established under the Administrative Procedure Act to formulate positions, obtain comments on draft texts throughout negotiations, and seek comments on proposed final texts. In the European Union, the Commission should open a public consultation when drafting negotiating mandates to mirror the legislative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trade Isn’t the Right Tool For Every Internet Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third front in our battle to reform the USTR’s closed and opaque trade negotiation practices is in a submission to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that we submitted this week. The ITC was seeking public submissions in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/news_release/2017/er0206ll719.htm&quot;&gt;enquiry on digital trade&lt;/a&gt;, to gather input into a report that it is writing to advise the USTR on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submission reiterates our demands that the USTR publish its proposals, publish draft texts, have an independent transparency officer, open up proposals to notice and comments and a public hearing process, and open up Trade Advisory Committees to be more inclusive. But it also points out that the USTR shouldn’t consider trade negotiations as the right tool to regulate every aspect of the Internet that touches on trade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Commission aims to describe regulatory and policy measures currently in force in important markets abroad that may significantly impede digital trade, our bottom line is that not all such measures that impede digital trade are necessarily protectionist. … [They may] also have important non-trade justifications that serve broader social and economic needs such as freedom of expression and access to information, consumer safety and privacy, and preservation of the stability and security of Internet networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail—and the USTR has been hammering away like mad at topics as diverse as net neutrality, domain names, encryption standards, and intermediary liability. But because there are many other dimensions of these issues besides the trade dimension, trade negotiations aren’t necessarily the best venue to address them; and certainly not while those negotiations remain as closed and opaque as they are at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the renegotiation of NAFTA is around the corner, the need for USTR to reform its outdated practices is becoming increasingly urgent. With Congress, consumer groups, and international trade experts all demanding similar reforms from the next Trade Representative, we certainly hope that Robert Lighthizer is feeling the heat, and that he will rise to the challenge once he takes office.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New Laptop Ban Adds to Travelers&#039; Lack of Privacy and Security</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-laptop-ban-adds-travelers-lack-privacy-and-security</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to understand the intent behind anti-terrorist security rules on travel and at the border. As our board member Bruce Schneier has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/11/beyond_security_thea.html&quot;&gt;vividly described&lt;/a&gt;, much of it can appear to be merely &quot;security theater&quot;—steps intended to increase the feeling of security, while doing much less to actually achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the U.S. government, without warning or public explanation, introduced a sweeping new device restriction on travelers flying non-stop to the United States from ten airports in eight Muslim-majority countries, and nine airlines from those countries. Passengers on these flights must now pack large electronics (including tablets, cameras, and laptops) into their checked luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-unveils-new-restrictions-on-travelers-from-eight-muslim-majority-countries/2017/03/21/d4efd080-0dcb-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html&quot;&gt;still emerging&lt;/a&gt; regarding the rationale behind the ban, which went into effect at 3:00 Eastern Time Tuesday morning. The United Kingdom on Monday joined the United States with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39343971&quot;&gt;a similar regulation&lt;/a&gt; aimed at a differing set of flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new restrictions on the transport of digital devices that have provoked a growing sense of insecurity among personal and business travelers flying between America, the Middle East and Turkey, and rightly so. Travelers to and within the United States were already concerned over reports of increasing levels of warrantless inspection of their devices at the border of the United States. Earlier this month, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection revealed that there &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/13/american-citizens-us-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone.html&quot;&gt;were more device searches in February alone&lt;/a&gt; than were conducted in the whole of the 2015 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few consolations is that these invasive searches take place with your knowledge, during security searches of your body and personal items. As we recently described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017&quot;&gt;our guide to digital searches at the border&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/border-agents-need-warrant-search-travelers-phones-eff-tells-court&quot;&gt;our brief to the Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. border is not a rights-free zone: searches should be noted, and if known about, can be challenged as unlawful. There is also the small compensation that, if officials do not demand access to your laptop, tablet or phone, you can at least be confident that your digital possessions have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been invasively searched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring digital devices to be checked as luggage removes those reassurances, and adds new concerns. If someone else has physical access to your device almost all information security guarantees are off the table. Data can be cloned for later examination. If you encrypt your stored data, you might limit how much direct data can be extracted—but even so, you cannot stop the examiner from installing new spyware or hardware. New software can be installed for later logging or remote control; protections can be disabled or manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, it&#039;s very hard to make any assurances about how safe your personal data can be in transit. Some security researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/12/better-data-security-nail-polish/&quot;&gt;devised exotic ways&lt;/a&gt; to reveal physical tampering; others spend their time &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.defcon.org/forum/defcon/dc24-official-unofficial-parties-social-gatherings-events-contests/dc24-villages/tamper-evident-village-ac/222929-dc24-tamper-evident-village&quot;&gt;defeating those systems&lt;/a&gt;. But if your device is out of your possession, all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to assert that the new regulations are intended to enable these widespread, unaccountable searches. But given the content of the new regulation and the manner in which it was introduced, it&#039;s not surprising that rather than improving the confidence of travelers that their life and possessions remain safe and secure, it&#039;s led to even more doubt and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the United States authorities has provided little transparency into or notice of their decision, we have no idea what protection this regulation is attempting to provide. It is particularly unclear what the security benefit of limiting the ban to a few airlines and airports achieves. (Even if you believe, as officials within the Trump administration have stated, that some nationalities pose a particular threat, potential terrorists are surely smart enough to fly to an intervening nation which has not imposed the same controls, and take one of the multi-stop flights on which the United States still permits laptops as a carry-on.) At best, it seems like the real threat is so limited that the United States feels it not worth the cost to inconvenience other travelers. At worst, it adds to the sense that some crossing the border—for instance, citizens of these nations and American visitors to them—should have fewer protections and practical opportunities for legal defense against invasive searches at the border than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security theater, or not, improving security at the border includes as a goal ensuring the sense of security and confidence that travelers have that their personal data and devices are safe from unlawful interference. To do that, the United States authorities needs to be more transparent in its reasoning, more protective of the highly personal information held on digital devices, and far less arbitrary in its search and treatment of different groups of travelers. A strong set of legal safeguards consistent governing digital device searches of every traveller—whether they are U.S. citizens, residents, or visitors—would be more secure, and safer for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For practical advice for protecting your data at the border, see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017&quot;&gt;detailed new guide&lt;/a&gt; and printable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-border-search-pocket-guide&quot;&gt;border search pocket guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Patents Are A Big Part Of Why We Can’t Own Nice Things: the Supreme Court Should Fix That</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/patents-are-big-part-why-we-cant-own-nice-things-supreme-court-should-fix</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could allow companies to keep a dead hand of control over their products, even after you buy them.  The case, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Impression Products v. Lexmark International&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is on appeal from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, who last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/federal-circuit-sticks-its-guns-patent-owners-can-prevent-you-owning-anything&quot;&gt;affirmed its own precedent&lt;/a&gt; allowing patent holders to restrict how consumers can use the products they buy. That decision, and the precedent it relied on, departs from long established legal rules that safeguard consumers and enable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy something physical—a toaster, a book, or a printer, for example—you expect to be free to use it as you see fit: to adapt it to suit your needs, fix it when it breaks, re-use it, lend it, sell it, or give it away when you’re done with it. Your freedom to do those things is a necessary aspect of your ownership of those objects. If you can’t do them, because the seller or manufacturer has imposed restrictions or limitations on your use of the product, then you don’t really own them. Traditionally, the law safeguards these freedoms by discouraging sellers from imposing certain conditions or restrictions on the sale of goods and property, and limiting the circumstances in which those restrictions may be imposed by contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some companies are relentless in their quest to circumvent and undermine these protections. They want to control what end users of their products can do with the stuff they ostensibly own, by attaching restrictions and conditions on purchasers, locking down their products, and locking you (along with competitors and researchers) out. If they can do that through patent law, rather than ordinary contract, it would mean they could evade legal limits on contracts, and that any one using a product in violation of those restrictions (whether a consumer or competitor) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/federal-circuit-sticks-its-guns-patent-owners-can-prevent-you-owning-anything&quot;&gt;could face harsh penalties for patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Impression Products v. Lexmark International&lt;/i&gt; is Lexmark’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/if-first-you-dont-succeed-dont-try-again-patent-law&quot;&gt;latest attempt&lt;/a&gt; to prevent purchasers from reusing and refilling its ink cartridges with cheaper ink. If Lexmark can use patent law to accomplish this, it won’t just affect the person or company that buys the cartridge, but also anyone who later acquires or refills it, even if they never agreed to what Lexmark wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will turn on how the Supreme Court applies patent law’s “exhaustion doctrine.” As the Court explained in its unanimous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/06/supreme-court-victory-patent-first-sale-doctrine&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quanta v. LG Electronics &lt;/i&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;, the exhaustion doctrine provides that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/quanta.pdf&quot;&gt;“the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights.”&lt;/a&gt; Meaning, a patent holder can’t use patent rights to control what you can do with the product you’ve purchased, because they no longer have patent rights in that particular object. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/supreme-court-merits-brief&quot;&gt;we explained in a brief&lt;/a&gt; submitted along with Public Knowledge, Mozilla, the AARP, and R Street Institute to the Supreme Court, the doctrine protects both purchasers and downstream users of patented products. Without the exhaustion doctrine, patent holders would be free to impose all kinds of limits on what you can do with their products, and can use patent infringement’s severe penalties as the enforcement mechanism. The doctrine also serves patent law’s constitutional purpose—to promote progress and innovation—by ensuring that future innovators have access to, and can research and build on, existing inventions, without seeking permission from the patent holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/if-first-you-dont-succeed-dont-try-again-patent-law&quot;&gt;isn’t Lexmark’s first bite at the apple&lt;/a&gt;. The company first tried to argue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive&quot;&gt;that copyright law, and section 1201 of the DMCA&lt;/a&gt; (which prohibits circumvention of DRM), gave it the right to prevent re-use of its toner cartridges. In 2004, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive&quot;&gt;the Sixth Circuit roundly rejected Lexmark’s copyright claims&lt;/a&gt;. The court explained that even if Lexmark could claim copyright in the code at issue, and while it might want to protect its market share in cartridges, “that is not the sort of market value that copyright protects.” The Sixth Circuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/lexmark-v-static-control-case-archive&quot;&gt;also shot down Lexmark’s section 1201 claims&lt;/a&gt;, stating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[n]owhere in its deliberations over the DMCA did Congress express an interest in creating liability for the circumvention of technological measures designed to prevent consumers from using consumer goods while leaving copyrightable content of a work unprotected. In fact, Congress added the interoperability provision in part to ensure that the DMCA would not diminish the benefit to consumers of interoperable devices &quot;in the consumer electronics environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lost on its copyright claims, Lexmark found a warmer welcome at the Federal Circuit, who last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2016/02/16/lexmark_v_impression_prod.pdf&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; that so long as the company “restricted” the sale of its product (in this case through a notice placed on the side of the cartridge) Lexmark could get around patent exhaustion, and retain the right to control downstream users’ behavior under patent law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit’s ruling in &lt;i&gt;Lexmark&lt;/i&gt; seriously undermines the exhaustion doctrine, allowing patent holders to control users’ behavior long after the point of purchase merely by including some form of notice of the restriction at the point of sale. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/federal-circuit-sticks-its-guns-patent-owners-can-prevent-you-owning-anything&quot;&gt;As we’ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, this is especially troubling because downstream users and purchasers may be entirely unaware of the patent owner’s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit’s the ruling is also significantly out of step with how the majority of the law treats these kinds of restrictions. While sellers can use contract law to bind an original purchaser to mutually agreed-upon terms (with some limits) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/federal-circuit-sticks-its-guns-patent-owners-can-prevent-you-owning-anything&quot;&gt;for hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt;, courts have disfavored sellers’ attempts to use &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; laws to control goods after a transfer of ownership. Courts and legal scholars have long acknowledged that such restrictions impair the purchasers’ personal autonomy, interfere with efficient use of property, create confusion in markets, and increase information costs. The Federal Circuit’s ruling is even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/01/23/brief-lexmark-merits.pdf&quot;&gt;out of step with copyright law&lt;/a&gt;, whose exhaustion principle is codified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109&quot;&gt;first sale doctrine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re hopeful that the Supreme Court will reverse the Federal Circuit and bring patent law’s exhaustion doctrine back in line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supreme Court: A Patent Owner Can Lie In Wait</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/supreme-court-patent-owner-can-lie-wait</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/supreme-court-opinion-sca-hygiene-v-first-quality-baby-products&quot;&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; today that will cheer up patent trolls, the Supreme Court said patent owners can lie in wait for years before suing. This will allow trolls to sit around while others independently develop and build technology. The troll can then jump out from under the bridge and demand payment for work it had nothing to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s 7-1 decision arrives in a case called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/sca-hygiene-v-first-quality-baby-products&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;SCA Hygiene v. First Quality Baby Products&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This case involves a patent on adult diapers but has a much broader reach. The court considered whether the legal doctrine of “laches” applies in patent cases. Laches is a principle that penalizes a rightsholder who “sleeps on their rights” by waiting a long time to file a lawsuit after learning of a possible infringement. It protects those that would be harmed by the assertion of rights after a lengthy delay. For example, laches would work against a patent owner that saw an infringing product emerge yet waited a decade to sue, after significant investment of time and resources had been put into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling in &lt;i&gt;SCA &lt;/i&gt;follows a similar decision in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16343772915477319302&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Petrella v. MGM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holding that laches is not available as a defense in copyright cases. The Supreme Court has generally rejected “patent exceptionalism” and has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/watch-out-trolls-supreme-court-expands-fee-shifting-patent-cases&quot;&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/01/reverses-patentees-infringement.html&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Circuit for creating special rules for patent law. So today’s decision was not especially surprising. In our view, however, there were compelling historical and policy arguments for retaining a laches defense in patent law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/&quot;&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, EFF filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-pk-amicus-brief-supreme-court&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; at the Supreme Court explaining the many ways that companies accused of patent infringement can be harmed if the patent owner sleeps on its rights. For example, evidence relevant to invalidity can disappear. This is especially true for software and Internet-related patents. In his dissent, Justice Breyer cited our brief and explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he passage of time may well harm patent defendants who wish to show a patent invalid by raising defenses of anticipation, obviousness, or insufficiency. These kinds of defenses can depend upon contemporaneous evidence that may be lost over time, and they arise far more frequently in patent cases than any of their counterparts do in copyright cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven justices in the majority suggested that patent defendants might be able to assert “equitable estoppel” instead of laches. But that would likely require showing that the patent owner somehow encouraged the defendant to infringe. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1270160&quot;&gt;most cases&lt;/a&gt;, especially patent troll cases, the defendant has never even heard of the patent or the patent owner before receiving a demand. This means estoppel is unlikely to be much help. Ultimately, today’s ruling is a victory for trolls who would wait in the shadows for years before using an obscure patent to tax those who do the hard work of bringing products and services to market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hearing Wednesday: EFF Testifying Before House Committee That Use of Facial Recognition by Law Enforcement Poses Critical Threat to Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/hearing-wednesday-electronic-frontier-foundation-testifying-house-committee-use</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;One Out of Two Americans Already in a Face Recognition Database Accessible to Law Enforcement&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington, D.C.—On Wednesday, March 22, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Senior Staff Attorney Jennifer Lynch will testify at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/law-enforcements-use-facial-recognition-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the FBI&#039;s efforts to build up and link together massive facial recognition databases that may be used to track innocent people as they go about their daily lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The FBI has amassed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/foia/fbis-next-generation-identification-biometrics-database&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;facial recognition database&lt;/a&gt; of more than 30 million photographs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/fbi-can-search-400-million-face-recognition-photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has access to hundreds of millions more&lt;/a&gt;. The databases include photos of people who aren’t suspected of any criminal activity that come from driver’s license and passport and visa photos, even as the underlying identification technology becomes ever more powerful. The government has done little to address the privacy implications of this massive collection of biometric information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Lynch will testify that the use of facial recognition technology will allow the government to track Americans on an unprecedented level. The technology, like other biometric programs, such as fingerprint and DNA collection, poses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/memo-doj-facial-recognitions-threat-privacy-worse-anyone-thought&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical threats to privacy&lt;/a&gt; and civil liberties. Lynch will tell the House committee that Congress has an opportunity to develop legislation that would protect Americans from inappropriate and excessive biometrics collection and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What: Full House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/law-enforcements-use-facial-recognition-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hearing&lt;/a&gt;: Law&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Enforcement’s Use of Facial Recognition Technology&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Border Agents Need A Warrant to Search Travelers’ Phones, EFF Tells Court</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/border-agents-need-warrant-search-travelers-phones-eff-tells-court</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;The Border Isn’t a Constitution-Free Zone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Richmond, Virginia—Border agents must obtain a warrant to search travelers’ phones, tablets, and laptops, which contain a vast trove of sensitive, highly personal information that is protected by the Fourth Amendment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-kolsuz-eff-amicus-brief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; told&lt;/a&gt; a federal appeals court today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Searches of devices at the border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have more than doubled&lt;/a&gt; since the inauguration of President Trump—from nearly 25,000 in all of 2016, to 5,000 in February alone. This increase, along with the increasing number of people who carry these devices when they travel, has heightened awareness of the need for stronger privacy rights while crossing the U.S. border.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires law enforcement officials to get a warrant supported by probable cause before searching our property, in cases that predate the rise of digital devices, courts granted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/law-enforcement-uses-border-search-exception-fourth-amendment-loophole&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;border agents the power&lt;/a&gt; to search our luggage without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But portable digital devices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; differ wildly from luggage or other physical items we carry with us to the airport because they provide access to the entirety of our private lives, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;EFF said in an amicus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-kolsuz-eff-amicus-brief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the border search case &lt;i&gt;U.S. v. Kolsuz&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In 2014 the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/riley-wurie-supreme-court-opinions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that cellphones now hold “the privacies of life” for people, including &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;highly personal, private information such as photos, texts, contact lists, email messages, and videos. Many digital devices can access personal records stored in the “cloud,” such as financial or medical information. Before smartphones were invented, that kind of information would be kept in our home offices, desk drawers, or basement storage. If law enforcement officers wanted to enter your home or lock box as part of a search, they’d need to go before a judge, prove probable cause that you’re involved in a crime, and get a warrant.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The border isn’t a constitution-free zone,” said Adam Schwartz, EFF senior staff attorney. “The U.S. Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/supreme-court-sets-powerful-limits-cell-searches-fails-protect-internet-streaming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruled in 2014 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that mobile phones are a window into our private lives and police need to show there’s probable cause that the people they arrest have committed crimes and obtain a warrant to search their phones. There should be no less protection for individuals who have not been arrested or shown to have committed any crime, but who instead simply want to enter the United States.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s never been more important for courts to follow the standard set by the Supreme Court about cell phone searches and apply it to borders searches. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/fear-materialized-border-agents-demand-social-media-data-americans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; have surfaced of border agents searching the devices of innocent U.S. citizens, green card holders, and foreign visitors. While all kinds of travelers have suffered this intrusion, many reports involve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpj.org/2017/02/bbc-journalist-questioned-by-us-border-agents-devi.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;, Muslim-Americans, and Americans with Middle Eastern-sounding names&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, Brennan Center for Justice, Council on American-Islamic Relations and six of its chapters, and The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers joined EFF in filing the brief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Law enforcement officials should be required to meet the same standards for searching our cell phones wherever we are—in our cities, on the highway, at vehicle checkpoints, and at the border. Regardless of the location, when officials want to crack open the private information in someone’s phone, they must first obtain a warrant,” said Schwartz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hearing Wednesday: National Security Letters Violate the First Amendment</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/hearing-wednesday-national-security-letters-violate-first-amendment</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;EFF to Argue NSL Gag Orders Are Unconstitutional in San Francisco Appeals Court&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco – The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will urge an appeals court Wednesday to find that the FBI violates the First Amendment when it unilaterally gags recipients of national security letters (NSLs), and the law should therefore be found unconstitutional. The hearing is set for Wednesday, March 22, at 1:30pm in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF represents two communications service providers—CREDO Mobile and Cloudflare—that were restrained for years from speaking about the NSLs they received, including even acknowledging that they had received any NSLs. Early Monday, just days before the hearing, the FBI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/notice-regarding-public-identification-nsl-recipients&quot;&gt;finally conceded&lt;/a&gt; that EFF could reveal that these two companies were fighting a total of five NSLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CREDO and Cloudflare have fought for years to publicly disclose their roles in battling NSL gag orders. Both companies won the ability to talk about some of the NSLs they had received several months ago, but Monday’s decision by the FBI allows them to acknowledge all the NSLs at issue in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, EFF Staff Attorney Andrew Crocker will tell the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that these gags are unconstitutional restrictions on CREDO and Cloudflare’s free speech and that the FBI’s belated decision to lift some of the gags only underscores why judicial oversight is needed in every case. The gag orders barred these companies from participating in discussion and debate about government use of NSLs—even as Congress was debating changes to the NSL statute in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What:&lt;br /&gt;
In re National Security Letters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who:&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Five Creepy Things Your ISP Could Do if Congress Repeals the FCC’s Privacy Protections</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/21/og-post-isp-paley-once.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-trying-roll-back-internet-privacy-protections-you-read&quot;&gt;so worried about Congress repealing the FCC’s privacy rules for ISPs&lt;/a&gt;? Because we’ve seen ISPs do some disturbing things in the past to invade their users’ privacy. Here are five examples of creepy practices that could make a resurgence if we don’t stop Congress now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Call Congress and help keep creepy ISP practices a thing of the past!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;creepy5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Selling your data to marketers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which ISPs did it before?&lt;/b&gt; We don’t know—but they’re doing it as you read this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that many ISPs think they’re sitting on a gold mine of user data that they want to sell to marketers. What some people don’t realize is that some are already doing it. (Unfortunately they’re getting away with this for now because the FCC’s rules haven’t gone into effect yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ad Age, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adage.com/article/datadriven-marketing/24-billion-data-business-telcos-discuss/301058/&quot;&gt;SAP sells a service called Consumer Insights 365&lt;/a&gt;, which “ingests regularly updated data representing as many as 300 cellphone events per day for each of the 20 million to 25 million mobile subscribers.” What type of data does Consumer Insights 365 “ingest?” Again, according to Ad Age, “The service also combines data from telcos with other information, telling businesses whether shoppers are checking out competitor prices… It can tell them the age ranges and genders of people who visited a store location between 10 a.m. and noon, and link location and demographic data with shoppers&#039; web browsing history.” And who is selling SAP their customers’ data? Ad Age says “SAP won&#039;t disclose the carriers providing this data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, mobile broadband providers are too afraid to tell you, their customers, that they’re selling data about your location, demographics, and browsing history. Maybe that’s because it’s an incredibly creepy thing to do, and these ISPs don’t want to get caught red-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of getting caught red-handed, that brings us to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;creepy4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. Hijacking your searches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which ISPs did it before?&lt;/b&gt; Charter, Cogent, DirecPC, Frontier, Wide Open West (to name a few)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/widespread-search-hijacking-in-the-us&quot;&gt;several ISPs were caught red-handed working with a company called Paxfire to hijack  their customers’ search queries to Bing, Yahoo!, and Google&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you entered a search term in your browser’s search box or URL bar, your ISP directed that query to Paxfire instead of to an actual search engine. Paxfire then checked what you were searching for to see if it matched a list of companies that had paid them for more traffic. If your query matched one of these brands (e.g. you had typed in “apple”, “dell”, or “wsj”, to name a few) then Paxfire would send you directly to that company’s website instead of sending you to a search engine and showing you all the search results (which is what you’d normally expect). The company would then presumably give Paxfire some money, and Paxfire would presumably give your ISP some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, ISPs were hijacking their customers’ search queries and redirecting them to a place customers hadn’t asked for, all while pocketing a little cash on the side. Oh, and the ISPs in question hadn’t bothered to tell their customers they’d be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/update-paxfire-and-search-redirection&quot;&gt;sending their search traffic to a third party that might record some of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe we’re still on the subtle end of the creepy spectrum. But things are about to get a whole lot more in-your-face creepy, with…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Snooping through your traffic and inserting ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which ISPs did it before?&lt;/b&gt; AT&amp;amp;T, Charter, CMA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest one people are worried about, and with good reason—ISPs have every incentive to snoop through your traffic, record what you’re browsing, and then inject ads into your traffic based on your browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of ISPs have done it before—&lt;a href=&quot;http://webpolicy.org/2015/08/25/att-hotspots-now-with-advertising-injection/&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did it on some of their paid wifi hotspots&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/05/charter-enhances-internet-service-with-targeted-ads/&quot;&gt;Charter did it with its broadband customers&lt;/a&gt;; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stopthecap.com/2013/04/03/isp-crams-its-own-ads-all-over-your-capped-internet-connection-banners-block-your-view/&quot;&gt;smaller ISP called CMA did the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t think this one requires much explaining for folks to understand just how privacy invasive this is. But if you need a reminder, we’re talking about the company that carries all your Internet traffic examining each packet in detail&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref1_0iby6ew&quot; title=&quot;To be absolutely precise, your ISP could track and record all your HTTP traffic, and the domain name you visit for HTTPS websites.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote1_0iby6ew&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; to build up a profile on you, which they can then use to inject even more ads into your browsing experience. (Or, even worse—they could hire a third-party company like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2008/11/nebuad-isps-sued-over-dpi-snooping-ad-targeting-program/&quot;&gt;NebuAd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/14/bt_phorm_2007/&quot;&gt;Phorm&lt;/a&gt; to do all this for them.) That’s your ISP straight up spying on you to sell ads—and turning the creepiness factor up to eleven.&lt;a class=&quot;see-footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnoteref2_5utngcj&quot; title=&quot;We’ve heard some arguments that is just what Google or Facebook do, but there’s a big difference. You can choose not to use Google or Facebook, and it’s easy to install free tools that block their tracking on other parts of the web. EFF even makes such a tool, called Privacy Badger! But changing ISPs or paying for a VPN is hard (and some people don’t have more than one choice of ISP). For more, see our post on busting three ISP privacy rollback myths.&quot; href=&quot;#footnote2_5utngcj&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; And speaking of spying, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Pre-installing software on your phone and recording every URL you visit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which ISPs did it before?&lt;/b&gt; AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy a new Android phone, you probably expect it to come with some bloatware—apps installed by the manufacturer or carrier that you’re never going to use. You &lt;i&gt;don’t&lt;/i&gt; expect it to come preinstalled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/carrier-iq-architecture&quot;&gt;software that logs which apps you use and what websites you visit and sends data back to your ISP&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s exactly what was uncovered when security researcher and EFF client &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/carrieriq-censor-research-baseless-legal-threat&quot;&gt;Trevor Eckhart did some digging into Carrier IQ&lt;/a&gt;, an application that came preinstalled on phones sold by AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even creepier than number three on our list (watching your traffic and injecting ads), because at least with number three, your ISP can only see your unencrypted traffic. With Carrier IQ, your ISP could also see what encrypted (HTTPS) URLs you visit and record what apps you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, preinstalled software like Carrier IQ gives your ISP a window into &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; you do on your phone. While mobile ISPs may have backed down on using Carrier IQ in the past (and the situation led to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carrieriqsettlement.com&quot;&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;), you can bet that if the FCC’s privacy rules are rolled back there’ll be ISPs be eager to start something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of these creepy practices holds a candle to the ultimate, creepiest thing ISPs want to do with your traffic, which is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Injecting undetectable, undeletable tracking cookies in all of your HTTP traffic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which ISPs did it before?&lt;/b&gt; AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one creepiest thing on our list of privacy-invasive practices comes courtesy of Verizon (and AT&amp;amp;T, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/11/14/att-supercookies-tracking/19041911/&quot;&gt;quickly killed a similar program&lt;/a&gt; after Verizon started getting blowback).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/verizon-x-uidh&quot;&gt;Back in 2014 Verizon Wireless decided that it was a good idea to insert supercookies into &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of its mobile customers’ traffic&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, you read that right—it’s as if some Verizon exec thought “inserting tracking headers into all our customers’ traffic can’t have a down side, can it?” Oh, and, for far too long, they didn’t bother to explicitly tell their customers ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse. Initially, there was no way for customers to turn this “feature” off. It didn’t matter if you were browsing in Incognito or Private Browsing mode, using a tracker-blocker, or had enabled Do-Not-Track: Verizon ignored all this and inserted a unique identifier into all your unencrypted outbound traffic anyway. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-338091A1.pdf&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t until “two years after Verizon Wireless first began inserting UIDH, that the company updated its privacy policy to disclose its use of UIDH and began to offer consumers the opportunity to opt-out of the insertion of unique identifier headers into their Internet traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, anyone—not just advertisers—could track you as you browsed the web. Even if you cleared your cookies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/verizon-and-turn-break-browser-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;advertisers could use Verizon’s tracking header to resurrect them&lt;/a&gt;, which led to something called “zombie cookies.” If that doesn’t sound creepy, we don’t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s a lot at stake in this fight. The FCC privacy rules congress is trying to kill would limit all of these creepy practices (and even ban some of them outright). So don’t forget to call your senators and representative &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;—because if we don’t stop Congress from killing the FCC’s ISP privacy rules now, we may end up with a lot more than five creepy ISP practices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Call Congress and help keep creepy ISP practices a thing of the past!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnote1_0iby6ew&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; href=&quot;#footnoteref1_0iby6ew&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; To be absolutely precise, your ISP could track and record all your HTTP traffic, and the domain name you visit for HTTPS websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;footnote2_5utngcj&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-label&quot; href=&quot;#footnoteref2_5utngcj&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/a&gt; We’ve heard some arguments that is just what Google or Facebook do, but there’s a big difference. You can choose not to use Google or Facebook, and it’s easy to install free tools that block their tracking on other parts of the web. EFF even makes such a tool, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pb&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt;! But changing ISPs or paying for a VPN is hard (and some people don’t have more than one choice of ISP).

    <title>Brazil Proposes New Digital Copyright Rules for the WTO</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/brazil-proposes-new-digital-copyright-rules-wto</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/what-does-ip-have-do-free-trade-unpicking-undemocratic-ttip&quot;&gt;don&#039;t belong in trade agreements&lt;/a&gt;—so where do they belong? For the most part, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/wipo&quot;&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WIPO) is probably the right place; it&#039;s a fully multilateral body that devotes its entire attention to copyright, patent, and other so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/the-term&quot;&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; (IP) rules, rather than including them as an afterthought in agreements that also deal with things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nmpf.org/latest-news/press-releases/jan-2016/dairy-industry-voices-pros-and-cons-tpp-front-us-international&quot;&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heritage.org/trade/report/rules-origin-can-make-or-break-the-trans-pacific-partnership&quot;&gt;rules of origin for yarn&lt;/a&gt;. Although we don&#039;t always like the rules that come out of WIPO, at least we can be heard there—and sometimes our participation makes a tangible difference. The landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/historic-milestone-rights-readers-un-negotiators-finalize-treaty-blind&quot;&gt;Marrakesh Treaty&lt;/a&gt; for blind, visually impaired and print disabled users provides a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#039;s another multilateral international body that can also lay claim to authority over international intellectual property rules—the World Trade Organization (WTO). When the WTO first covered copyright and patent rules in a dedicated agreement called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/trips&quot;&gt;TRIPS&lt;/a&gt;, it was decried by activists as being far too strict. Today, ironically, those same activists (even EFF) often tout TRIPS as a more appropriate baseline standard for global IP rules, in contrast to the stricter (or &quot;TRIPS-plus&quot;) rules demanded for inclusion in preferential trade agreements such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/acta&quot;&gt;Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (ACTA) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/acta&quot;&gt;Trans-Pacific Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (TPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who believe in linking copyright and trade, the WTO is an obvious candidate to fill the vacuum left by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/11/tpp-post-mortem&quot;&gt;TPP&#039;s recent demise&lt;/a&gt;. At the most recent session of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/trip_01mar17_e.htm&quot;&gt;WTO&#039;s TRIPS Council&lt;/a&gt; on March 1 and 2, Brazil &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/JOBs/GC/113.pdf&quot;&gt;circulated a paper&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] titled &quot;Electronic Commerce and Copyright&quot; to address issues around trade in copyright works in the digital age. This document didn&#039;t come out of the blue; it draws strongly upon an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/why-wipo-cant-fix-copyright&quot;&gt;discussion paper&lt;/a&gt;, also addressing the challenges of copyright in the digital environment, that Brazil and others in its GRULAC (Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries) group introduced at WIPO in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#039;s latest paper highlights three issues around electronic commerce and copyright that it believes belong on the WTO&#039;s agenda; not as the basis for a binding treaty, but for discussion and informal coordinated action by member states. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While copyright holder groups complain that Internet platforms don&#039;t pay enough for streaming copyright content (a so-called &quot;value gap&quot;), a big part of the perceived problem is that it&#039;s difficult for the creators of that content to know where the money is going. The music industry, in particular, is notorious for the opacity of the payment arrangements between intermediaries and creators such as songwriters and performers. Brazil identifies the need to improve the transparency of these payments, although it doesn&#039;t go into detail about how this should be accomplished. When EFF brought musician and entrepreneur &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/copyright-digital-environment&quot;&gt;Imogen Heap to WIPO&lt;/a&gt;, she explained the potential for blockchain technology to provide this much-needed transparency. But rather than invest in exploring this or other transparency initiatives, big media has continued to devote most of its attention to a failing war on piracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance of rights and obligations &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The paper correctly identifies the need to maintain balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of users of copyright works, as technologies change and new ways of using such works emerge. But the paper goes off the rails when it suggests that it may be unlawful under the WTO&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/joint-statement-civil-society-groups-us-tpp-copyright-proposal&quot;&gt;three-step test&lt;/a&gt; for countries to allow users to bypass DRM on copyright works, on the grounds that DRM is &quot;essential for the normal exploitation of works in e-trade.&quot; Although we support the paper&#039;s bottom-line conclusion that &quot;WTO Members should unequivocally assert the principle that exceptions and limitations available in physical formats should also be made available in the digital environment,&quot; we don&#039;t think this precludes rolling back penalties for the circumvention of DRM. On the contrary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-16-years-under-dmca&quot;&gt;circumvention is often the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way&lt;/a&gt; for users to gain access to content on the devices of their choice, and is imperative for preservation, archival, and reuse of such content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territoriality of copyright &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The final issue addressed in Brazil&#039;s paper is the most fundamental one: the disconnect between the global nature of the Internet, and the territorial status of national copyright systems. The problem that Brazil identifies is that by using international credit cards, users can gain access to content through overseas content platforms, and thereby circumvent services based in their own home countries, which are subject to that country&#039;s copyright rules. It proposes that &quot;Member states should make their best efforts to make their national copyright legislation applicable to trade relations where content is accessed from within their national borders.&quot; But if this means blocking or banning users from accessing overseas content services, we have serious concerns. Such measures are entirely unnecessary anyway, as the world already has a common set of copyright rules as standards for global trade—that&#039;s exactly what the WTO TRIPS agreement provides. Brazil hasn&#039;t made out a case for more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, other WTO members have shown little appetite for the WTO to undertake new work on copyright rules, with the knowledge that such negotiations would be highly contentious. (This is also why Brazil has chosen to describe it as an &quot;electronic commerce&quot; proposal rather than as an &quot;intellectual property&quot; proposal.) However, the promulgation of &quot;soft law&quot; standards on copyright protection under the aegis of the WTO is a more tenable proposition, and Brazil&#039;s aim with this paper is to seed that process. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to keep a watchful eye even on non-normative documents such as these, to ensure that if the WTO does take any new measures on global copyright rules, users&#039; rights are preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If the Government Can&#039;t Get Domain Seizures Right, Why Would Big Pharma Do Better?</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/if-government-cant-get-domain-seizures-right-why-should-we-expect-better-big</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we&#039;ve seen no response from the Domain Name Association (DNA) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/healthy-domains-revisited-pharmaceutical-industry&quot;&gt;our criticisms from earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; about its self-styled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedna.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DNA_Healthy_Practices_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;Registry/Registrar Healthy Practices&lt;/a&gt; [PDF]. Part of its plan is that domain registries ought to yank online pharmacy domains from the Internet without due process on Big Pharma&#039;s say-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/styles/large/public/2017/03/17/screen_shot_2017-03-17_at_92837_am.png?itok=j1jBi-Fh&quot; alt=&quot;ICE seizure notice for vicodin.com&quot; class=&quot;image-large&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an interesting new data point about the wisdom of such a policy emerged this week. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/ice-seizes-vicodincom-2017-3&quot;&gt;It has been reported&lt;/a&gt; that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, had seized the domain vicodin.com, named after a common prescription pain medication. The problem? That domain actually belongs to the manufacturer and registered trademark holder for Vicodin. In other words, it seems that the domain should never have been seized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve never been fans of the ICE&#039;s domain name seizures. They have been used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/ice-seizures-raising-new-speech-concerns&quot;&gt;violate free speech rights&lt;/a&gt;, without &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/09/23&quot;&gt;any meaningful opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for the owner or users of the domain to be heard before the domain is seized. But at least such seizures are issued under a warrant issued by a United States District Court judge, and there is a mechanism of redress (however slow and inconvenient) when a domain is seized wrongfully. That&#039;s what happened to the music blog Dajaz1, whose domain was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/unsealed-court-records-confirm-riaa-delays-were-behind-year-long-seizure-hip-hop&quot;&gt;seized by ICE&lt;/a&gt; and kept offline for over a year while the recording industry tried and failed to come up with evidence of copyright infringement. And it&#039;s what apparently happened today to vicodin.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If responsibility for the seizure of domain names passes to domain name registries or registrars, at the direction of Big Pharma—as the DNA proposes—all bets are off. We can well imagine that if the DNA&#039;s proposal is accepted as an industry-wide practice the number of mistaken domain name seizures will skyrocket, and that its victims will have even less recourse than they have against an ICE seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not just pharmacy domains that are at risk. Under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/mpaa-may-donuts-they-shouldnt-be-copyright-police&quot;&gt;private policy of the registry operator Donuts&lt;/a&gt;, an architect of the Healthy Domains Initiative, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has similar powers as Big Pharma to call for the deletion or transfer of domain names that are alleged to host copyright-infringing material. Although EFF was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/shadow-regulation-withers-sunlight&quot;&gt;defeat a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to make a similar policy into an industry-wide practice, we doubt we&#039;ll have heard the last of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Name Regulator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/icann&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; met with its community this week in Copenhagen. Big Pharma and Big Content lobbyists were among those who descended on the gathering, to promote their vision of private Internet content enforcement through the domain name system; a privatized SOPA, if you will. So far, ICANN &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/news/blog/icann-is-not-the-internet-content-police&quot;&gt;has resisted&lt;/a&gt; accepting any such enforcement role, and rightly so. Today&#039;s reminder that even the U.S. government can&#039;t get this method of enforcement right should send a further note of caution about this misguided approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF, ACLU, and 45 Civil Rights, Immigration, and Health Advocacy Organizations Oppose AB 165, a California Bill Stripping Students and Teachers of Basic Privacy Protections</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eff-aclu-and-45-civil-rights-immigration-and-health-advocacy-organizations-oppose</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/17/calecpa-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;“Californians cannot afford to go back to the digital dark ages,” groups warn.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF and a diverse coalition of advocacy groups sent a letter to the California legislature urging elected officials to oppose A,B, 165. This bill would roll back privacy protections for students and teachers by exempting California public schools from the prohibition on warrantless digital searches lawmakers enacted two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter calls for the legislature to protect the legal rights of the 6-million Californians who study and work in public schools. Signers included Transgender Law Center, Courage Campaign, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Health Connected, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, the American Library Association, and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attempt to strip away privacy protections comes during a tumultuous political moment in American history, where many political activists, immigrant families, and LGBTQ Americans are rightly fearful of federal policies that endanger their safety, privacy, and other civil liberties. The coalition letter called out these concerns specifically: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Students or staff from Muslim or immigrant communities are rightly concerned that they or their family members and friends would be at risk if their digital information were wrongfully obtained and misused. Half of California students have at least one immigrant parent – and more than half of these parents are not citizens. Members of the school community may fear reprisal for participating in online or real-world social or political activism that their school’s administration may not support. LGBTQ students or staff may have concerns about their personal and professional relationships and even their safety. And youth who live in poverty, for whom their cell phone may be their primary or only means of accessing the Internet and thus seeking information about health, sexuality, or other sensitive topics, are vulnerable to even greater exposure of their personal lives than other students with greater access to technology in the home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/17/ab_165_oppose_letter-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Read the full letter.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF urges concerned Californians to speak out against A.B. 165. &lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10472&quot;&gt;If you live in California, please contact your elected officials today. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are a student or teacher who has witnessed a device search by a school official in California, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/student-digital-device-survey&quot;&gt;please tell us about it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in California? You can still help by sharing this post on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Step Closer to Reclaiming University Innovation From Trolls</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/were-one-step-closer-reclaiming-university-innovation-trolls</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reclaim-invention&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2016/08/03/og-reclaim-invention.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, EFF, along with our partner organizations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/legislation-reclaim-university-invention-trolls&quot;&gt;launched Reclaim Invention&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign to encourage universities across the country to commit to adopting patent policies that advance the public good. Reclaim Invention asks universities to focus on by bringing their inventions to the public, rather than selling or licensing them to patent assertion entities whose sole business model is threatening other innovators with patent lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to Maryland State Delegate Jeff Waldstreicher, the project is taking a step forward. In February, Delegate Waldstreicher introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=billpage&amp;amp;stab=01&amp;amp;id=hb1357&amp;amp;tab=subject3&amp;amp;ys=2017RS&quot;&gt;H.B. 1357&lt;/a&gt;, a bill modeled on Reclaim Invention’s draft legislation, the Reclaim Invention Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention/legislation&quot;&gt;Reclaim Invention Act&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2017RS/bills/hb/hb1357f.pdf&quot;&gt;H.B. 1357&lt;/a&gt; would require Maryland state universities to adopt policies for technology transfer that commit them to managing their patent portfolio in the public interest, and outlines what that policy should include. The bill would also void any agreement by the university to license or transfer a patent to a patent assertion entity (or patent troll).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mgahouse.maryland.gov/mga/play/5fb43e7b-2eb2-42a2-834a-556690e6fb49/?catalog/03e481c7-8a42-4438-a7da-93ff74bdaa4c&amp;amp;playfrom=12963000&quot;&gt;At a hearing earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the Maryland Assembly’s House Appropriations Committee heard testimony in support of the bill from Delegate Waldstrecher, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI)’s James Love, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adamkriesberg.com/&quot;&gt;data scientist Adam Kreisberg&lt;/a&gt;.  As KEI’s James Love explained, the bill would allow universities to continue to license or assign patent rights to companies, but would prohibit them from assigning patents “to organizations who are just suing people for infringement.” According to Love, when it comes to public universities, &quot;you don’t want public sector patents to be used in a way that&#039;s a weapon against the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/17/eff-letter-hb1357.pdf&quot;&gt;EFF, with Public Knowledge, Creative Commons, and KEI [.pdf]&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2017/03/17/yk_letter_hb1497.pdf&quot;&gt; Yarden Katz, Fellow in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School [.pdf]&lt;/a&gt; also submitted written testimony supporting the bill. Katz, who studies &quot;the impact of commercialization on scientific research,” explains: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[r]esearch has shown that university patents, including those produced by public universities, can end up in the hands of NPRs. For instance, as of 2016, the notorious NPA ‘Intellectual Ventures’ had nearly 500 patents that originated from American universities in its portfolio…including some from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Maryland legislature passes the bill, Katz states it would “set an example for other states by adopting a framework for academic research that puts public interests front and center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in Maryland you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10469&quot;&gt;urge your lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to defend innovation and pass H.B. 1357.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=10469&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your state lawmakers: keep university patents away from trolls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not in Maryland, you can take action to encourage your university to sign the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention/pledge&quot;&gt;Public Interest Patent Pledge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/reclaim-invention/legislation&quot;&gt;urge your state lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to keep university patents out of the hands of trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three Myths the Telecom Industry is Using to Convince Congress to Repeal the FCC’s Privacy Rules, Busted</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/three-myths-telecom-industry-using-convince-congress-repeal-fccs-privacy-rules</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in October of 2016, the FCC passed some pretty awesome rules that would bar your internet service provider (ISP) from invading your privacy. The rules would keep ISPs like Comcast and Time Warner Cable from doing things like selling your personal information to marketers, inserting undetectable tracking headers into your traffic, or recording your browsing history to build up a behavioral advertising profile on you—unless they can get your consent. They were a huge victory for everyday Internet users in the U.S. who value their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the restrictions also limit the ability of ISPs and advertisers alike to profit from the treasure trove of data ISPs have about their subscribers, powerful interests have come out in force to strip those protections away. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/ad-industry-lobbyists-celebrate-impending-death-of-online-privacy-rules/&quot;&gt;Lobbyists in DC&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/296980/ad-industry-lobbies-against-confusing-broadband.html&quot;&gt;pulling out all the stops&lt;/a&gt; trying to convince Congress that these straightforward, no-nonsense privacy rules are unnecessary, unfair, overly burdensome, or all of the above. EFF wrote a memo for congressional staffers that busts these myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re sharing the content of that memo with you, Team Internet, so you can see the type of FUD  ISPs and their allies are pushing in order to take away your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fair warning: some of these are fairly wonky, so if you’re not the type that gets excited by telecom law, you can always skip to the part where you &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;call your senators and representative and tell them not to repeal the FCC’s ISP privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;—because if we raise our voices together, we can stop Congress before it’s too late.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Congress now and tell them not to repeal the FCC&#039;s privacy rules!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;myth1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Myth 1:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;If the FCC’s privacy rules are repealed&lt;/i&gt;, s&lt;i&gt;tate officials and the Federal Trade Commission will fill the gap—so customers’ privacy will still be protected.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact: &lt;/b&gt;Unfortunately, recent court decisions have limited the FTC’s ability to enforce privacy rules on ISPs. Plus, relying on each state to enforce its own laws to protect privacy would create a terrible patchwork of mismatched regulations. You’d think with all the uncertainty and bureaucracy that would create, the ISPs would actually &lt;i&gt;prefer&lt;/i&gt; clear, bright-line rules at the national level. But you’d be wrong: at this point, they’ll say anything to block the FCC’s privacy-protective rules.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extended Version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/08/29/15-16585.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;FTC v AT&amp;amp;T Mobility&lt;/i&gt; decision at the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Circuit&lt;/a&gt; eliminated the Federal Trade Commission’s authority to enforce privacy rules on ISPs in Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Other courts may do the same. And while some states’ Attorney Generals have brought actions against ISPs that mislead or deceive consumers about how the companies collect, share, and sell customer data, many other states have scaled back their enforcement on the premise that federal enforcement was sufficient and preferable. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, a state-by-state patchwork of consumer protection enforcement is bad for customers &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; telecoms. It leaves customers in states with weaker consumer protection statutes or less assertive Attorneys General without crucial safeguards from their ISPs. And it leaves ISPs subject to a bewildering array of regulations depending on where they operate.  That regulatory thicket will impede competition and innovation by discouraging service providers from entering new markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;myth2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Myth 2: &lt;i&gt;Even if Congress repeals the FCC’s recent privacy rules, the FCC still has authority to enforce consumer privacy protections more generally under Section 222 of the Communications Act.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Due to the way Congress plans to repeal the FCC’s privacy rules, there’s going to be a lot of legal uncertainty about whether or not the FCC will be allowed to do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; related to ISPs and privacy in the future. In other words, it’s not clear if you’ll be at the mercy of your ISP or not, and by the time the courts figure it out, your ISP will have already had the chance to do some pretty creepy things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extended Version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Section 222 of the Communications Act is the underlying authorization for the rules the FCC has already adopted, but if Congress passes a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to repeal the rules, whether or not the FCC can pass new rules using that authority will be an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/congress-contemplating-making-it-illegal-protect-consumer-privacy-online&quot;&gt;a CRA resolution would prohibit the FCC from issuing rules that are “substantially the same” in the future&lt;/a&gt;. If the FCC brings an action against an ISP under Section 222 for mishandling customer data, the ISP would likely try to challenge the action in court on the grounds that Congress preempted the agency with the CRA, creating uncertainty around ISP obligations and consumer privacy protections.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;myth3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Myth 3:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The FCC’s privacy rules put Internet service providers at an unfair disadvantage when compared to Internet companies like Google who can profit off of consumer&lt;/i&gt;s’ &lt;i&gt;data.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fact:&lt;/b&gt; Google doesn’t see everything you do on the Internet (neither does Facebook, for that matter, or any other online platform)—they only see the traffic you send to them. And you can always choose to use a different website if you want to avoid Google’s tracking. None of that is true about your ISP. You probably only have one, maybe two options when it comes to ISPs offering high-speed Internet, and your ISP sees everything—they have to, in order to send your traffic to the right place. That’s why we need the FCC’s privacy rules: ISPs are in a position of power, and they’ve shown they’re willing to abuse that power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you’re worried about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/new-and-improved-privacy-badger-20-here&quot;&gt;creepy third-party tracking&lt;/a&gt; online, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;you can use free tools to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;; the only way to protect your privacy from your ISP is to pay for a VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extended Version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;To begin with, it’s worth remembering that ISPs and companies like Google or Facebook see entirely different parts of your Internet activity; namely that Google or Facebook only see the traffic you send to their servers, while ISPs see &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; your traffic. Even when you take into account the fact that Google and Facebook have creepy third-party trackers spread across the web, they still only see a fraction of what your ISP sees. Being able to see all of your traffic gives your ISP an unprecedented view into your life (everything from what you’re shopping for, to who you talk to, to what your politics are, to what you read), which not even Google or Facebook can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also another big difference between Comcast and Google: choice. While Internet users can choose between numerous online services for search, email, and more—including services that feature built-in privacy protections as a selling point—most consumers have few if any options when it comes to choosing an ISP. According to the FCC’s 2016 Broadband Progress Report, 51 percent of households have access to only one high-speed broadband provider. If that provider decides to sell their data, they can’t vote with their wallets and choose another ISP. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one last difference: Internet users can &lt;i&gt;prevent&lt;/i&gt; companies like Google from spying on them as they surf the web. If you want to do something online without being tracked, you can use a variety of free tools that even powerful companies like Google cannot overcome. But nothing short of paying to use a virtual private network—essentially having to pay a fee to protect your online privacy—will protect you from your ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve heard the FUD ISPs and the advertising industry are spreading, take a moment and help us protect your privacy from data-hungry ISPs: call Congress &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt; and tell your senators and representative not to repeal the FCC’s ISP privacy rules!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California Youth in Detention and Foster Care Deserve Internet Access</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/california-youth-detention-and-foster-care-deserve-internet-access</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s 2017, and climbers can tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/when-the-internet-came-to-everest&quot;&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;, astronauts can post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo&quot;&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; from the International Space Station, and ocean explorers can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/06/mariana-trench-live-feed-engrossing-viewing-from-deepest-place-on-earth&quot;&gt;live stream&lt;/a&gt; from the Mariana Trench.  Considering the ability for technology to overcome those harsh environments, we see no reason that California can’t develop a way to ensure that youth in our state have secure and supervised access to the internet in juvenile detention and foster care programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF is throwing its support behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB811&quot;&gt;A.B. 811&lt;/a&gt;, a California bill sponsored by Assemblymember Mike Gipson, that would establish that youth in custody have a right to “reasonable access to computer technology and the internet for the purposes of education and maintaining contact with family and supportive adults.” The bill would also establish the right of youth in foster care to have access to computers and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As EFF writes in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/california-ab-811-support-letter&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When youth are incarcerated, it is the government’s duty to ensure that they receive the necessary services for rehabilitation and successful integration back into the free world. Computer literacy and computer skills are crucial to development in the modern era, particularly when it comes to finding jobs. In addition, since many facilities are located in remote areas, placing youth far from their homes, accommodations should be made using modern technology to allow detainees to maintain meaningful relationships with their families to enhance the support structure for successful rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, youth in foster care must also have access to the same resources that most children receive through their schools, libraries, and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 56,000 youth were in foster care in 2015, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/6243-children-in-foster-care?loc=1&amp;amp;loct=1#detailed/2/6/false/573,869,36,868,867/any/12987&quot;&gt;Annie E. Casey Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cjsc/publications/misc/jj14/preface.pdf&quot;&gt;California Department of Justice data&lt;/a&gt; [.pdf] reports that more than 23,000 youth were detained in secure facilities in 2014, with Hispanic youth representing more than half and Black youth representing roughly a quarter of youth in secure custody. We applaud Assemblymember Gipson for his efforts to ensure this significant at-risk population is provided with the tools they need to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Payment Processors are Still Policing Your Sex Life, and the Latest Victim is FetLife</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/payment-processors-are-still-policing-your-sex-life</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteenth century writer and philosopher the Marquis de Sade spent the last 13 years of his life in prison for his crimes of writing pornographic novels such as &lt;em&gt;Justine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Juliette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today those who explore and write about similar sexual fantasies online—now known as BDSM and grounded in the consent of all participants—are suffering similar acts of censorship as the eponymous literary sadist who preceded them by two centuries. The biggest difference is that the church and state have been supplanted as chief censors by private companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/free-speech-weak-link#payment%20&quot;&gt;payment service providers&lt;/a&gt; Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago EFF defended the right of publishers such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/legal-censorship-paypal-makes-habit-deciding-what-users-can-read&quot;&gt;Smashwords&lt;/a&gt; to publish written descriptions of transgressive sexual conduct, against PayPal&#039;s threat to cancel payment services unless they withdrew such works from sale. (Following our campaign, in which we were joined by more than two dozen other free speech groups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/paypal-announces-new-speech-friendly-policy-online-book-sales&quot;&gt;PayPal relented&lt;/a&gt;.) In the same year the Nifty Archives Alliance, which publishes erotic stories, had its donation page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/payment-provider-stripe-upholds-free-speech-reactivates-nifty-archives&quot;&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; by its payment processor for fear of violating Visa and Mastercard rules. Two years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/caving-government-pressure-visa-and-mastercard-shut-down-payments-backpagecom&quot;&gt;Backpage.com&lt;/a&gt; had its payment services suspended by Visa and Mastercard for providing a platform to advertise sexual services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year it&#039;s the turn of adult social network &lt;a href=&quot;https://fetlife.com/&quot;&gt;FetLife&lt;/a&gt;, which just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/news-and-ideas/opinion/just-happened-kink-social-network-fetlife-bad-sign-web-freedom-214928?m=%2Fprivacy-policy%2Fterms-of-useprivacy-policy&quot;&gt;lost its ability to process credit card payments&lt;/a&gt; because it offers a platform for members to discuss and to post depictions of consensual BDSM practices. In this instance the ban appears to have come down from one of the credit card networks, which shut down both of the merchant accounts that FetLife used to process payments, justifying this to one merchant with complaints about &quot;blood, needles, and vampirism&quot; on the website, and to the other with the vague explanation of &quot;illegal or immoral reasons&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any illegal content were on the website that would indeed be cause for concern, but there is no evidence of this. The last time FetLife lost payment processing services in 2013, it was on the basis of complaints of illegal child pornography on the site. Yet on closer investigation, this turned out to amount to sexualized cartoon drawings of the Simpsons, which even if they may have been in poor taste, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-795.ZO.html&quot;&gt;constitutionally protected speech&lt;/a&gt; under U.S. law. Even so, the site clamped down on fantasy depictions or descriptions of underage sex and incest going forward, and its payment processing services were restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no further evidence of illegal content on FetLife today than there was back then. Nor does it seem obvious the card networks&#039; content rules have been infringed; both networks prohibit imagery of &quot;non-consensual sexual behavior&quot; and &quot;non-consensual mutilation of a person or body part&quot;, but consensual BDSM is neither of these. Nonetheless, the credit card ban has had its desired effect of further constricting the range of permissible speech on FetLife, with the site introducing new restrictions on a broad range of edgy sexual practices, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinkipedia.wikidot.com/wiki:consensual-non-consent&quot;&gt;consensual non-consent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jezebel.com/5868600/when-prejudice-is-sexy-inside-the-kinky-world-of-race-play&quot;&gt;race play&lt;/a&gt;, drug and alcohol use, and scarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, their payment services &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; haven&#039;t been reinstated, and it&#039;s unclear how they can be. In the meantime FetLife does still accept payments via Bitcoin, which due to its open and decentralized infrastructure, is much more resistant to censorship pressures. While there may one day be a future in which digital currencies like Bitcoin are so widely adopted that it&#039;s easy for many websites to thrive on them alone, today we live in a world where credit card oligopolies can effectively shut down digital speech they find annoying or offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of a round of buck-passing between PayPal and the credit card networks during the Smashwords dispute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160429143841/http://www.bannedwriters.com/2012/03/10/visa-writes-us-back-this-is-not-our-doing-paypal-censorship-erotica/&quot;&gt;Visa had written&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Visa would take no action regarding lawful material that seeks to explore erotica in a fictional or educational manner. As you note in your letter, Visa is not in the business of censoring cultural product.&quot; While we don&#039;t know which of the card networks were responsible for the latest FetLife ban, such fine sentiments seem hard to square with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s also difficult to discern what&#039;s behind this latest crackdown, but the least likely scenario is that it was a case of proactive self-policing by the credit card network. More likely, this is a case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/shadow-regulation&quot;&gt;Shadow Regulation&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/amazon-and-wikileaks-first-amendment-only-strong&quot;&gt;hand of government&lt;/a&gt;, or some third party acting as self-appointed morals campaigner, has reached a secret agreement with the payment network behind the scenes. In this context, it may be worth noting that Attorney-General Jeff Sessions recently indicated that he would consider reviving the Justice Department&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xbiz.com/news/216100&quot;&gt;Obscenity Prosecution Task Force&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the source of the pressure to which the payment network acceded, EFF remains deeply concerned that payment companies aren&#039;t doing enough to consistently push back against demands to privately censor lawful sexual content online. In an age where the &lt;em&gt;50 Shades&lt;/em&gt; movies are playing in mainstream cinemas across the country, society ought to have moved on from the days when pornographers such as de Sade were jailed and his books burned. The best way for payment companies to discern when online content has crossed the line into obscenity is to rely on courts to make that judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>D.C. Circuit Court Issues Dangerous Decision for Cybersecurity: Ethiopia is Free to Spy on Americans in Their Own Homes</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/dc-circuit-court-issues-dangerous-decision-cybersecurity-ethiopia-free-spy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b6ec49e8-cf33-c7fc-5893-c3b73b876b65&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E0C614D73F037CAD852580E3004EE648/$file/16-7081-1665840.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that foreign governments are free to spy on, injure, or even kill Americans in their own homes--so long as they do so by remote control. The decision comes in a case called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/kidane-v-ethiopia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kidane v. Ethiopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which we filed in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; February 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our client, who goes by the pseudonym Mr. Kidane, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia and has lived here for over 30 years. In 2012 through 2013, his family home computer was attacked by malware that captured and then sent his every keystroke and Skype call to a server controlled by the Ethiopian government, likely in response to his political activity in favor of democratic reforms in Ethiopia. In a stunningly dangerous decision today, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the D.C. Circuit ruled that Mr. Kidane had no legal remedy against Ethiopia for this attack, despite the fact that he was wiretapped at home in Maryland. The court held that, because the Ethiopian government hatched its plan in Ethiopia and its agents launched the attack that occurred in Maryland from outside the U.S., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) prevented U.S. courts from even hearing the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision is extremely dangerous for cybersecurity. Under it, you have no recourse under law if a foreign government that hacks into your car and drives it off the road, targets you for a drone strike, or even sends a virus to your pacemaker, as long as the government planned the attack on foreign soil. It flies in the face of the idea that Americans should always be safe in their homes, and that safety should continue even if they speak out against foreign government activity abroad.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Factual background &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. Kidane discovered traces of state-sponsored malware called FinSpy, a sophisticated spyware product which its maker claims is sold exclusively to governments and law enforcement, on his laptop at his home in suburban Maryland. A forensic examination of his computer showed that the Ethiopian government had been recording Mr. Kidane’s Skype calls, as well as monitoring his (and his family’s) web and email usage. The spyware was launched when Kidane opened an attachment in an email. The spying began at his home in Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The spyware then reported everything it captured back to a command and control server in Ethiopia, owned and controlled by the Ethiopian government. The infection was active from October 2012 through March 2013, and was stopped just days after researchers at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab released a report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; exposing Ethiopia&#039;s use of FinSpy. The report specifically referenced the very IP address of the Ethiopian government server responsible for the command and control of the spyware on Mr. Kidane’s laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We strenuously disagree with the D.C. Circuit’s opinion in this case. Foreign governments should not be immune from suit for injuring Americans in their own homes and Americans should be as safe from remote controlled, malware, or robot attacks as they are from human agents. The FSIA does not require the courts to close their doors to Americans who are attacked, and the court’s strained reading of the law is just wrong. Worse still, according to the court, so long as the foreign government formed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;even the smallest bit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of its tortious intent abroad, it’s immune from suit. We are evaluating our options for challenging this ruling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Foilies 2017</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/foilies-2017</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recognizing the Year’s Worst in Government Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-cover-color.jpg&quot; width=&quot;276&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;A thick fog is rolling in over &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunshineweek.rcfp.org/&quot;&gt;Sunshine Week&lt;/a&gt; (March 12-18), the annual event when government transparency advocates raise awareness about the importance of access to public records.  We are entering an age when officials at the highest levels seek to discredit critical reporting with “alternative facts,” “fake news” slurs, and selective access to press conferences—while making their own claims without providing much in the way to substantiate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much the pundits claim we’re entering a “post-truth” era, it is crucial we defend the idea of &lt;i&gt;proof&lt;/i&gt;.  Proof is in the bureaucratic paper trails. Proof is in the accounting ledgers, the legal memos, the audits, and the police reports. Proof is in the data. When it comes to government actions, that proof is often obtained by leveraging laws like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and state-level public records laws—except when government officials seek to ignore the rules to suppress evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is also par for the course. As award-winning investigative reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shane_bauer/status/835318038241001472&quot;&gt;Shane Bauer&lt;/a&gt; recently posted on Twitter: “I’ve been stonewalled by the government throughout my journalistic career. I’m seriously baffled by people acting like this is brand new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; presents “The Foilies,” our anti-awards identifying the times when access to information has been stymied or when government agencies have responded in the most absurd ways to records requests. Think of it as the Golden Raspberries but for government transparency, where the bad actors are actually going off script to deny the public the right to understand what business is being conducted on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compile these awards, EFF solicited nominations from around the country and scoured through news stories and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOIAFriday?src=hash&quot;&gt;#FOIAFriday&lt;/a&gt; Twitter threads to find the worst, the silliest, and the most ridiculous responses to request for public information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;maoa&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Make America Opaque Again Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commitment to public transparency should start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from the beginning of his campaign, President Trump has instead committed to opacity by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns.html&quot;&gt;refusing to release his tax returns&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns about an ongoing IRS audit. Now that he&#039;s been elected, Trump&#039;s critics, ethics experts, and even some allies have called on him to release his tax returns and prove that he has eliminated potential conflicts of interest and sufficiently distanced himself from the businesses in his name that stand to make more money now that he&#039;s in office. But the Trump administration has not changed its stance. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, the American public should be outraged that we now have the first sitting president since the 1970s to avoid such a baseline transparency tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;pence&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hypocrisy Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Former Indiana Governor—and current Vice President—Mike Pence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice President Mike Pence cared a lot about transparency and accountability in 2016, especially when it came to email. A campaign appearance couldn&#039;t go by without Pence or his running mate criticizing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for using a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.  In fact, the Foilies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/foilies-2016-recognizing-worst-government-responses-public-records-requests/#selfserver&quot;&gt;honored Clinton&lt;/a&gt; last year for her homebrewed email approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pence seemed much less bothered by those transparency and accountability concerns when he used a private AOL email address to conduct official business as Indiana&#039;s governor. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/02/pence-used-personal-email-state-business----and-hacked/98604904/&quot;&gt;Indianapolis Star&lt;/a&gt; reported in February that Pence used the account to communicate &quot;with top advisors on topics ranging from security gates at the governor’s residence to the state’s response to terror attacks across the globe.&quot; That means that critical homeland security information was kept in an account likely less secure than government accounts (his account was reportedly hacked too), and Pence&#039;s communications were shielded from government records requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;whitecastle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/nakamoto.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Frogmarch Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Town of White Castle, Louisiana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that could’ve made reporter Chris Nakamoto’s public records request in the small town of White Castle, Louisiana a more absurd misadventure is if he’d brought Harold and Kumar along with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chief Investigator for WBRZ in Baton Rouge, Nakamoto filed records requests regarding the White Castle mayor’s salary. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbrz.com/news/leaders-avoid-questions-nakamoto-escorted-away-in-handcuffs-given-summons&quot;&gt;when he turned up with a camera crew&lt;/a&gt; at city hall in March 2016 to demand missing documents, he was escorted out in handcuffs, locked in a holding cell for an hour, and charged with a misdemeanor for “remaining after being forbidden.” What’s worse is that Nakamoto was summoned to appear before the “Mayor’s Court,” a judicial proceeding conducted by the very same mayor Nakamoto was investigating.  Nakamoto lawyered up and the charges were dropped two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If anything, my arrest showed that if they’ll do that to me, and I have the medium to broadcast and let people know what’s happening to me, think about how they’re treating any citizen in that town,” Nakamoto says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-spot-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;tape&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Arts and Crafts Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are used to receiving documents covered with cross-outs and huge black boxes. But in May 2016, Associated Press reporters encountered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/05/17/no-peeking-government-records-censored-with-scotch-tape-paper.html&quot;&gt;a unique form of redaction&lt;/a&gt; from Public Health Agency of Canada when seeking records related to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-company-metabiota-problems-during-ebola-outbreak/&quot;&gt;Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As journalist Raphael Satter wrote in a letter complaining to the agency: “It appears that PHAC staff botched their attempt to redact the documents, using bits of tape and loose pieces of paper to cover information which they tried to withhold. By the time it came into my hands much of the tape had worn off and the taped pieces had been torn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the wryest transparency advocates were amused when Satter wrote about the redaction art project on Twitter, but the incident did have more serious implications. At least three Sierra Leonean medical patients had their personal information exposed. Lifting up the tape also revealed how the agency redacted information that the reporters believed should’ve been public, such as email signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said it would investigate, but Satter says he hasn’t heard anything back for 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;clarke&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-spot-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Whoa There, Cowboy Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke rose to prominence in 2016 as one of then-candidate Donald Trump’s top surrogates, prone to making inflammatory remarks about the Black Lives Matter movement, such as calling them a hate group and linking them to ISIS. But the press has also been a regular target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Political Watchdog Columnist Daniel Bice filed a series of records requests with the sheriff’s office, demanding everything from calendars, to details about an NRA-funded trip to Israel, to records related to a series of jail deaths.  So far, Clarke has been extremely slow to release this information, while being extremely quick to smear the reporter on the sheriff’s official Facebook page. Clarke frequently refers to the publication as the “Urinal Sentinel” and has diagnosed Bice with “Sheriff Clarke Derangement Syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I deal with open records requests with local governments and police departments, I do it at the city, county, and state level,” Bice says. “He’s by far the worst for responding to public records.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2016 Clarke published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MilwaukeeCountySheriff/posts/10153981181395189&quot;&gt;short essay&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook titled, “When Journalism Becomes an Obsession.” Clarke claimed that after he rejected Bice’s request for an interview, Bice retaliated with a series of public records requests, ignoring the fact that these requests are both routine and are often reporter’s only recourse when an official refuses to answer questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This lazy man’s way of putting together newspaper columns uses tax-paid, government employees as pseudo-interns to help him gather information to write stories,” Clarke wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to Clarke: requesting and reviewing public records is tedious and time-consuming, and certainly not the way to score an easy scoop. If anything, ranting on Facebook, then issuing &lt;a href=&quot;http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntySheriff/sheriffnews/Current-Year-News-Release/012717SheriffAnswersFakeNewsStory.pdf&quot;&gt;one-sentence news releases&lt;/a&gt; about those Facebook posts, are the lazy man’s way of being accountable to your constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Portland Commissioner Amanda Fritz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local citizen in Portland, Ore. filed a records request to find out everyone that City Commissioner&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmandaFritzRN&quot;&gt; Amanda Fritz&lt;/a&gt; had blocked or muted from her Twitter account. This should’ve been easy. However, Fritz decided to go the long way, scribbling down each and every handle on a sheet of paper. She then rescanned that list in, and sent it back to the requester.  The records did show that Fritz had decided to hush accounts that were trying to affect public policy, such as @DoBetterPDX, which focuses on local efforts to help homeless people, and anonymous self-described urban activist @jegjehPDX.  Here’s a tip for officials who receive similar requests: all you need to do is go to your “Settings and Privacy” page, select the “Muted accounts” or “Blocked accounts” tab, and then click “export your list.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;wrongaddress&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-spot-5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Wrong Address Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americarisingpac.org/&quot;&gt;America Rising PAC&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative opposition research committee, has been filing FOIA requests on a number of issues, usually targeting Democrats. Following Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing, the PAC sent a FOIA to the Attorney General seeking emails referencing the death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But America Rising never received a response acknowledging the DOJ received the request. That’s because the DOJ sent it to a random federal inmate serving time on child pornography charges. The offender, however, was nice enough to forward the message to the PAC with a note railing against the “malicious incompetence” of the Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;gsa&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-spot-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;The Redaction of Interest Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General Services Administration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the threads that reporters have tried to unravel through the Trump campaign is how the prolific businessman would separate himself from his financial interests, especially regarding his 30-year contract with the federal government to build a Trump International Hotel at the location of the federally owned Old Post Office in D.C., a paper airplane’s flight from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/trump-gave-his-kids-a-big-stake-in-huge-government-deal-docu&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; filed a FOIA request with the General Services Administration for a copy of the contract. What they received was a highly redacted document that raised more questions than it answered, including what role Trump’s family plays in the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The American taxpayer would have no clue who was getting the lease to the building,” says reporter Aram Roston, who was investigating how Trump failed to uphold promises made when he put in a proposal for the project. “You wouldn’t know who owned this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pushing back, BuzzFeed was able to get certain sections unredacted, including evidence that Trump’s three children—Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric—all received a 7.425% stake through their LLCs, seemingly without injecting any money of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;fakenews&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Fake News Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Santa Maria Police Department&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Santa Maria Police Department in California joined many other agencies in using the online service Nixle to distribute public information in lieu of press releases. The agency told citizens to sign up for “trustworthy information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a year later, police broke that trust. The Santa Maria Police posted to its Nixle account a report that two individuals had been arrested and deported, which was promptly picked up the local press. Months later, court documents revealed that it had all been a lie to ostensibly help the individuals—who had been targeted for murder by a rival gang—escape the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police were fiercely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.com/news/2016/dec/05/fake-press-release-defended-santa-maria-police-chi/&quot;&gt;unapologetic&lt;/a&gt;. The agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.santamariasun.com/news/15823/santa-maria-police-department-violated-public--notification-systems-terms-of-service-with-fake-press-release/&quot;&gt;has yet to remove&lt;/a&gt; the offending alert from Nixle or offer any kind of addendum, a direct violation of Nixle’s terms of service, which prohibits the transmission of “fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading communications” through the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;meter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Stupid Meter Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elster Solutions, Landis+Gyr, Ericsson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2016 several smart meter companies sued transparency website MuckRock and one of its users, Phil Mocek, in a failed attempt to permanently remove documents from the website that they claimed contained trade secrets. Some of the companies initially obtained a court order requiring MuckRock to take down public records posted to the site that the City of Seattle had already released to the requester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in their rush to censor MuckRock and its user, the companies overlooked one small detail: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/victory-court-ends-prior-restraint-against-muckrock&quot;&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. The Constitution plainly protected MuckRock’s ability to publish public records one of its users lawfully obtained from the City of Seattle, regardless of whether they contained trade secrets. A judge quickly agreed, ruling that the initial order was unconstitutional and allowing the documents to be reposted on MuckRock. The case and several others filed against MuckRock and its user later settled or were dismissed outright. The documents continue to be hosted on MuckRock for all to see. But, uh, great job guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;betatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Least Productive Beta Testing Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI spent most of 2016 doing what might be charitably described as beta testing a proprietary online FOIA portal that went live in March. But beta testing is probably a misnomer because it implies that the site actually improved after its initial rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI’s year of “beta testing” included initially proposing a requirement that requesters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedscoop.com/after-controversy-fbi-removes-id-requirement-for-efoia-requests/&quot;&gt;submit a copy of their photo ID&lt;/a&gt; before submitting a request via the portal and also imposed “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/fbi-foia-efoipa-freedom-of-information-act-fax-email/&quot;&gt;operating hours&lt;/a&gt;” and limited the number of requests an individual could file per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even after the FBI walked back from those proposals, the site appears designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/fr/deeplinks/2017/02/fbi-throws-digital-roadblock-transparency&quot;&gt;frustrate the public’s ability&lt;/a&gt; to make the premiere federal law enforcement agency more transparent. The portal limits the types of requests that can be filed digitally to people seeking information about themselves or others. Requesters cannot use the site to request information about FBI operations or activities, otherwise known as the bread and butter of FOIA requests. Oh, and the portal’s webform is capped at 3,000 characters, so brevity is very much appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, now that the portal is online, the FBI has stopped accepting FOIA requests via email, meaning fax and snail mail are now supposed to be the primary (and frustratingly slow) means of sending requests to the FBI. It almost seems like the FBI is affirmatively trying to make it hard to submit FOIA requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;foialobby&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Undermining Openness Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;U.S. Department of Justice &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vice.com/article/it-took-a-foia-lawsuit-to-uncover-how-the-obama-administration-killed-foia-reform&quot;&gt;Documents released&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 in response to a FOIA lawsuit by the Freedom of the Press Foundation show that the U.S. Department of Justice secretly lobbied Congress in 2014 to kill a FOIA reform bill that had unanimously passed the U.S. House of Representatives 410-0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the secret axing of an overwhelmingly popular transparency bill wasn’t even the most odious aspect of DOJ’s behavior. In talking points disclosed via the lawsuit, DOJ strongly opposed codifying a “presumption of openness,” a provision that would assume by default that every government record should be disclosed to the public unless an agency could show that its release could result in foreseeable harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOJ’s argument: “The proposed amendment is unacceptably damaging to the proper administration of FOIA and of the government as a whole,” which is bureaucratese for something like “What unhinged transparency nut came up with this crazy presumption of openness idea anyway?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be Obama, whose FOIA guidance on his first day in office back in 2009 was the blueprint for the presumption of openness language included in the bill. Perhaps DOJ thought it had to save Obama from himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOJ’s fearmongering won out and the bill died. Two years later, Congress eventually passed a much weaker FOIA reform bill, but it did include the presumption of openness DOJ had previously fought against. We’re still waiting for the “government as a whole” to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;missouri&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Outrageous Fee Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When public agencies get requests for digital data, officials can usually simply submit a query straight to the relevant database.  But not in Missouri apparently, where officials must use handcrafted, shade-grown database queries by public records artisans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s the only explanation we can come up with for why the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcur.org/post/missouri-sunshine-law-request-yields-15-million-tab-then-5000-then-outright-refusal#stream/0&quot;&gt;estimated that it would take roughly 35,000 hours&lt;/a&gt; and $1.5 million to respond to an exceedingly simple request for state birth and death data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit Reclaim the Records, whose name pretty eloquently sums up its mission, believed that a simple database query combined with copy and paste was all that was needed to fulfill its request. Missouri officials begged to differ, estimating that it would take them the equivalent of a person working around the clock for more than four years to compile the list by hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the fee estimate is not the highest the Foilies has ever seen—that honor goes to the Pentagon for its $660 million estimate in response to a MuckRock user’s FOIA request last year—Missouri’s estimate was outrageous. Stranger still, the agency later revised their estimated costs down to $5,000 without any real explanation. Reclaim the Records tried negotiating further with officials, but to no avail, as officials ultimately said they could not fulfill the request. Reclaim the Records has since filed a lawsuit for the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;neworleans&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Dehumanization Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lafayette City Marshall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public officials often dehumanize the news media to score cheap points, but can the same ploy work when fighting public records requests? That’s the issue in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://theind.com/article-23891-The-city-marshals-appeal-holding-technical.html&quot;&gt;very strange case&lt;/a&gt; between the IND, a Lafayette media outlet, and a city marshal. After the marshal lost his bid to keep records secret in the trial court, he appealed on the grounds that IND had no right to bring the lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marshal, who faced fines, community service, and house arrest for failing to turn over records, argues that Louisiana’s public records law requires that a living, breathing human make a request, not a corporate entity such as IND. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: there is no dispute that an actual human filed the request, which sought records relating to &lt;a href=&quot;http://theind.com/article-21933-city-marshal-attacks-garber-in-bizarre-presser.html&quot;&gt;a bizarre news conference&lt;/a&gt; in which the marshal allegedly used his public office to make baseless allegations against a political opponent. Instead, the dispute centers on a legal formalism of whether IND can sue on its own behalf, rather than suing under the name of the reporter. The marshal’s seemingly ridiculous argument does have some basis in the text of the statute, which defines a requester as a person who is at least 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s an incredibly cynical argument, putting the letter well over the spirit of the law in what appears to be a well-documented effort by the marshal to violate the law and block public access. We hope the learned Louisiana appellate judges see through this blatant attempt to short-circuit the public records law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;lethal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/13/foia-spot-4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Lethal Redaction Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;States of Texas and Arizona &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed Reporters Chris McDaniel and Tasneem Nashrulla have been on a quest to find out where states like Texas and Arizona are obtaining drugs used in lethal injection, as some pharmaceutical suppliers have decided not to participate in the capital punishment machine. But these states are fighting to keep the names of their new suppliers secret, refusing to release anything identifying the companies in response to BuzzFeed’s FOIA requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the crux of the investigation is whether the states attempted to obtain the drugs illegally from India. At least one shipment is currently being detained by the FDA. The reason for transparency is obvious if one looks only at one previously botched purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrismcdaniel/texas-almost-bought-execution-drugs-from-5-guys-overseas-who&quot;&gt;the reporters uncovered&lt;/a&gt;: Texas had tried to source pentobarbital from an Indian company called Provizer Pharma, run by five 20-year-olds. Indian authorities raided their offices for allegedly selling psychotropic drugs and opioids before the order could be fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Poor Note-taker Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secretary of the Massachusetts Commonwealth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to Massachusetts’ public records laws were set to take effect in January 2016, with Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin tasked with promulgating new regulations to clear up the vague language of the law. But Galvin didn’t exactly take his duty seriously. Instead he crafted a regulation allowing his office to dodge requirements that public records appeals be handled in a timely fashion. But no regulation could take affect without public hearing. So he went through the motions and dispatched an underling to sit at a table and wait out the public comment – but didn’t keep any kind of record of what was said. A close-up captured by a&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/binj-reports/talk-to-the-hand-because-bill-galvin-aint-listenin-61e30c647d1a#.6bkevlr75&quot;&gt; Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism&lt;/a&gt; reporter showed a pen lying on a blank pad of paper. Asked by a reporter about the lack of notes, the underling said, “I was just here to conduct this hearing. That’s all I can say.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ICANN&#039;s Special Privileges for Trademark Owners are The.Worst</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/icanns-special-privileges-trademark-owners-are-theworst</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If gaining control of hundreds of Internet domains that resemble your business name at a single stroke sounds like a trademark lawyer&#039;s wet dream, you may be surprised to learn that this is just one of the special powers that brand owners have under a little-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/icann&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, the Trademark Clearinghouse. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/trademark-scholars-letter-icann-gnso-rpm-working-group&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; released today by twenty-one law professors and practitioners exposes this and other privileges that ICANN bestows on brand owners, and sounds an urgent note of caution to the ICANN working group that is currently reviewing these special powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the flaws in ICANN&#039;s complex multi-stakeholder structure is the deference paid to private commercial interests. Within ICANN&#039;s Generic Names Supporting Organization (which is responsible for developing policy for most Internet domains), there are no fewer than five separate constituency groups representing commercial interests, and only two representing the interests of non-commercial and not-for-profit interests. One of the commercial constituencies is the influential and well-funded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipconstituency.org/&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property Constituency&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes the interests of trademark and copyright holders within ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a sustained lobbying effort, in 2013 the Intellectual Property Constituency won an unprecedented set of new powers for trademark holders as a condition of ICANN&#039;s subsequent introduction of hundreds of new top-level domains. Perhaps the worst of these is the Trademark Clearinghouse, a system that gives brand owners special powers to prevent the registration of domain names that contain their trademarks. This veto power applies even in cases where their use in a domain name is not actually a trademark infringement—for example because of the defense of fair use, or because the domain name is in a different category of goods or services to that in which the mark is used, or because the words in the mark are only protected as part a distinctive design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly egregious example of the abuse of the Trademark Clearinghouse is in the veto power reportedly granted to an English company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedomains.com/2017/02/01/the-trademark-clearinghouse-worked-so-well-one-company-got-24-new-gtld-using-the-famous-trademark-the/&quot;&gt;over the use of the word &quot;The&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in ICANN&#039;s new domains. (We say &quot;reportedly&quot; because the Trademark Clearinghouse doesn&#039;t provide any search function enabling us to verify trademark record registrations; quite a backward leap in transparency when compared with national trademark registries.) The company granted this power doesn&#039;t, as far as we could ascertain, operate in the &lt;span&gt;automotive, gambling, health services, or education sectors. And yet it has been able to use the veto powers obtained through the Trademark Clearinghouse to gain priority status to register domains such as the.cars, the.casino, the.doctor, the.school, and the.university—amongst many others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN&#039;s acquiescence to even the most outlandish demands of the trademark lobby has also set a precedent enabling some registries to go even further; for example, the registry Donuts (which we recently exposed as an architect of the copyright-blocking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/healthy-domains-initiative-censorship-through-shadow-regulation&quot;&gt;Healthy Domains Initiative&lt;/a&gt;) offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donuts.domains/services/dpml-plus/dpml-plus-overview&quot;&gt;DPML-Plus&lt;/a&gt; program that allows brand owners to block registrations not only of their registered marks, but also substrings, misspellings and variants of those marks, across hundreds of domains, for a period of ten years. We are aware of no national trademark system anywhere in the world that provides such extensive privileges to brand owners. Neither is there any convincing reason why the domain industry should be providing them with such privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/trademark-scholars-letter-icann-gnso-rpm-working-group&quot;&gt;letter to ICANN&lt;/a&gt; exposes this scam and calls upon ICANN to stop being so solicitous to brand owners at the expense of other legitimate users of the domain name system. In particular, we are very clear that ICANN should not extend the Trademark Clearinghouse to top-level domains that it doesn&#039;t already cover, such as the most widely used domains .com, .org, and .net. Looking forward, ICANN should also review the failings of the Trademark Clearinghouse system and roll it back from the more than 1,000 domains to which it already applies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Report Slams European Link Tax and Upload Filtering Plans</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/leaked-report-slams-european-link-tax-and-upload-filtering-plans</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eu-internet-advocates-launch-campaign-stop-eus-dangerous-copyright-filtering&quot;&gt;Earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; we explained how the tide is turning against the European Commission&#039;s proposal for Internet platforms to adopt new compulsory copyright filters as part of its upcoming Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. As we explained, users and even the European Parliament&#039;s Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) have criticized the Commission&#039;s proposal, which could stifle online expression, hinder competition, and suppress legal uses of copyrighted content, like creating and sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://savethememe.net/&quot;&gt;Internet memes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, a leaked report has revealed that one of the European Parliament&#039;s most influential committees &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/03/comodini-report-copyright/&quot;&gt;has also come out against the proposal&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;amp;reference=PE-599.682&amp;amp;format=PDF&amp;amp;language=EN&amp;amp;secondRef=01&quot;&gt;the IMCO committee&#039;s report had done,&lt;/a&gt; the report of the European Parliament&#039;s Legal Affairs (JURI) Committee not only criticizes the upload filtering proposal (aka. Article 13, or the #censorshipmachine), but renders even harsher judgment on a separate proposal to require online news aggregators to pay copyright-like licensing fees to the publishers they link to (aka. Article 11, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/european-copyright-leak-exposes-plans-force-internet-subsidize-publishers&quot;&gt;link tax&lt;/a&gt;). We&#039;ll take these one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JURI Committee Scales Back the EU&#039;s Censorship Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JURI committee would maintain the requirement for copyright holders to &quot;take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rightsholders for the use of their works.&quot; But the committee rejects the proposed requirement for automatic blocking or deletion of uploaded content, because it fails to take account of the limitations and exceptions to copyright that Europe recognizes, such as the right of quotation. The committee writes in an Explanatory Statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process cannot underestimate the effects of the identification of user uploaded content which falls within an exception or limitation to copyright. To ensure the continued use of such exceptions and limitations, which are based on public interest concerns, communication between users and rightsholders also needs to be efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee also affirms that the agreements between rightsholders and platforms don&#039;t detract from the safe harbor protection for platforms that Europe&#039;s E-Commerce Directive already provides (which is analogous to the DMCA safe harbor in the U.S.). This means that if user-uploaded content appears on a platform without a license from the copyright holder, the platform&#039;s only obligation is to remove that content on receipt of a request by the copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would have liked to see a stronger denunciation of the mandate for Internet platforms to enter into licensing agreements with copyright holders, and we maintain that the provision is better deleted altogether. Nonetheless, the committee&#039;s report, if reflected in the final text, should rule out the worst-case scenario of platforms being required to automatically flag and censor copyright material as it is uploaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;European Link Tax Faces its Toughest Odds Ever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked report goes further in its response to the link tax, recommending that it be dropped from the new copyright directive altogether. Given the failure of smaller scale link tax schemes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/google-news-shuts-shop-spain-thanks-ancillary-copyright-law&quot;&gt;Germany and Spain&lt;/a&gt;, this was the only sensible position for the committee to take. The Explanatory Statement to the report correctly distinguishes between two separate aspects of the use of news reporting online that the Commission&#039;s original proposal incorrectly conflates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation makes it easier for content found in press publications to be copied or taken. Digitalisation also facilitates access to news and press by providing digital users a referencing or indexing system that leads them to a wide range of news and press. Both processes need to be recognised as separate processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of introducing new monopoly rights for publishers, the JURI committee suggests simplifying the process by which publishers can take copyright infringement action in the names of the journalists whose work is appropriated. This would address the core problem of full news reports being republished without permission, but without creating new rights over mere snippets of news that accompany links to their original sources. Far from being a problem, this use is actually beneficial for news organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JURI committee report is just a recommendation for the amendment of the European Commission proposal, and it will still be some months before we learn whether these recommendations will be reflected in the final compromise text. Nonetheless, it is heartening to see the extreme proposals of the Commission getting chiseled away by one of the Parliament&#039;s most influential committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of this shouldn&#039;t be underestimated. Although the above proposals are limited to Europe at present, there is the very real prospect that, if they succeed, they will pop up in the United States as well. In fact, U.S. content industry groups are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2015-0013-90321&quot;&gt;already advocating&lt;/a&gt; for the adoption of an upload filtering proposal stateside. That&#039;s why it&#039;s vital not only for Europeans to speak out against these dangerous proposals, but also for Internet users around the world to stand on guard, and to be ready to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EFF Applauds Amazon For Pushing Back on Request for Echo Data</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eff-applauds-amazon-pushing-back-request-echo-data</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of Internet-enabled sensors in homes across the country is steadily increasing. These sensors are collecting personal information about what’s going on inside the home, and they are doing so in a volume and detail never before possible. The law, of course, has not kept up. There are no rules specifically designed for law enforcement access to data collected from in-home personal assistants or other devices that record what’s going on inside the home, even though the home is considered the heart of Fourth Amendment protection. That’s why it’s critical that companies push back on requests via currently existing rules for data collected via these new in-home devices.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; EFF applauds Amazon for doing just that—pushing back on a law enforcement request for in-home recordings from its Echo device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widely-publicized case involves a first-degree murder investigation out of Bentonville, Arkansas. The victim, Victor Collins, was found in November 2015 his friend’s home. The two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/prosecutors-get-warrant-amazon-echo-data-arkansas-murder-case-n700776&quot;&gt;had been&lt;/a&gt; drinking and watching football with a few others at the friend’s home the night before. The friend, James Bates, was charged with first-degree murder. He pled not guilty and is currently awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a search of the defendant’s home in December 2015, police found an Amazon Echo in the kitchen. The police seemed to think that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-echo/&quot;&gt;device&lt;/a&gt;—which is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xkcd.com/1807/&quot;&gt;always listening&lt;/a&gt;” to its surrounding for its “wake” words, Alexa, Echo, or Amazon—may have recorded what went on inside the home. They seized the device and later served Amazon with a warrant for any “audio recordings, transcribed records, or other text records related to communications and transactions” between the Echo device and Amazon’s servers for a 48-hour period surrounding the incident, along with subscriber and account information. Amazon turned over the defendant’s subscriber information and purchase history, but it refused to turn over any recordings or transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police sought to get the data via another route. A few months later, they got a second warrant—this time to search the devices they had in their possession: the physical Echo device and the defendant’s two cell phones (which, if the defendant used the Alexa app, could have contained Alexa recordings or transcripts). They were able to “extract the data” stored on the Echo device and one of the defendant’s phones, but the second phone was encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, the State of Arkansas informed Amazon that it intended to enforce the original warrant. Amazon filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3473747/Amazon-Memorandum-Seeking-to-Quash-Echo-Search.pdf&quot;&gt;motion to quash&lt;/a&gt; the warrant on February 17, 2017. Amazon argued that the request for the Alexa recordings and transcripts implicated First Amendment protected speech and that the police therefore needed to make a heightened showing before it could compel Amazon to turn over the information. As Amazon explained, the First Amendment protects not only users’ verbal requests to Alexa, but also Alexa’s responses. Alexa’s responses are protected for two reasons. First, they contain expressive material specifically requested by the user, such as podcasts, books, or music. Second, the responses are also the speech of Amazon, and they are protected the same way that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14043487021439226200&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr&quot;&gt;search engine’s results are protected&lt;/a&gt;. (Read: Despite some early reports to the contrary, Amazon never argued that the device itself had constitutional rights.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon argued that because the police were seeking access to First Amendment protected content, they needed to show a compelling need for the information and establish a sufficient nexus between the information sought and the underlying investigation. The Bentonville police hadn’t done that, so Amazon was right to push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on Amazon’s motion was scheduled for March 8, but it was cancelled after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/14030057/1/amazon-drops-legal-fight-over-echo-recording-in-arkansas-murder-case.html&quot;&gt;defendant agreed&lt;/a&gt; to release the information to the authorities. With Bates’ consent, Amazon has since turned over the requested recordings to the Bentonville police. We applaud Amazon for sticking up for its user’s rights and pushing back until it had that consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Depending on what data is requested, generally applicable data protection laws may apply, but they may not in all cases, especially where the data requested is especially sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will the TPP Live on in NAFTA and RCEP?</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/will-tpp-live-nafta-and-rcep</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp&quot;&gt;Trans-Pacific Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (TPP) was the worst defeat suffered by big content since we killed SOPA and PIPA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/5-years-later-victory-over-sopa-means-more-ever&quot;&gt;five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. But our opponents are persistent, well-funded, and stealthy, and we can&#039;t expect them to give up that easily. So, just as they have continued to push for SOPA-like Internet censorship mechanisms in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/sopa-anyone-entertainment-lobby-uses-hearing-domain-names-revive-awful-censorship&quot;&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/sopa-lives-international-anti-counterfeiting-coalition&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/victory-cloudflare-against-sopa-court-order-internet-service-doesnt-have-police&quot;&gt;fora&lt;/a&gt;, so too we have been keeping a watchful eye for the recycling of TPP proposals into other trade negotiations. It hasn&#039;t taken long for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary steps towards the renegotiation of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-08/nafta-talks-likely-won-t-begin-until-later-this-year-ross-says&quot;&gt;have already begun&lt;/a&gt;, and Alan Davidson, former director of digital economy issues at the Commerce Department, has flagged the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/release-full-tpp-text-after-five-years-secrecy-confirms-threats-users-rights&quot;&gt;problematic e-commerce provisions&lt;/a&gt; of the TPP as suitable for transplanting into the renegotiated agreement. &quot;TPP is a terrific starting point,&quot; he is &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidetrade.com/trade/tpp-data-rules-still-seen-model-future-deals-nafta-renegotiation&quot;&gt;reported as saying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the other side of the world, TPP is also being touted as the right standard for Asia&#039;s secretive Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), whose negotiators met in Tokyo last week. This week an Independent Commission on Trade Policy, composing seven former trade negotiators and academics from the Asia-Pacific region, released a report titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/asia-pacific-trade-architecture&quot;&gt;Charting a Course for Trade and Economic Integration in the Asia-Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. The report recommends &quot;that policy makers should, in light of the U.S. withdrawal, advance the TPP’s high standards in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tying these developments together, the trade ministers of the former TPP countries, which include most of the NAFTA and RCEP members, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.direcon.gob.cl/difusion/difusion2017/febrero/Manual_logistico/Manual_Logistico_Prensa_Ingles.pdf&quot;&gt;convening in Chile next week&lt;/a&gt; [PDF], and it is expected that several countries will use that meeting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-07/australia-striving-for-tpp-minus-1-after-trump-s-withdrawal&quot;&gt;push for the resurrection of the TPP&lt;/a&gt;, without the participation of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the folly of this project is that by failing to learn from the history of the TPP&#039;s demise, the participating countries are doomed to repeat it. The proximate cause of the deal&#039;s collapse was not the withdrawal of the United States, but the factors that caused that withdrawal—widespread public dissatisfaction with the secrecy of these agreements and their domination by big business, all in the promise of economic gains that have failed to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the message that more than 200 civil society groups from across the world gave today, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citizen.org/documents/Chile-Ministerial-Letter.pdf&quot;&gt;a letter sent to their trade ministers&lt;/a&gt; as they head to Chile. The letter, which EFF endorsed, says in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[W]e believe it is not acceptable for TPP rules to be used as a model for future trade negotiations whether bilateral, regional or multilateral, including the World Trade Organisation. We urge you to accept that this model has failed, and to engage with us and others in a more open and democratic process to develop alternative approaches that genuinely serve the interests of our peoples, our nations and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/does-trumps-withdrawal-tpp-signal-new-approach-trade-agreements&quot;&gt;correcting the underlying faults&lt;/a&gt; in the process by which the TPP was negotiated, there is no point in attempting to replicate its provisions in future trade deals. We join colleagues from around the world in calling on trade ministers to abandon the closed, captured model of trade negotiation that led to the failed TPP. As disappointing for trade ministries as the failure of the TPP was, they need to head back to the drawing board, fix this broken process, and meaningfully consult with users before attempting any future trade deals that affect the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Digital Privacy at the U.S Border: A New How-To Guide from EFF</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/digital-privacy-us-border-new-how-guide-eff</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Protect Yourself While Traveling To and From the U.S.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco - Increasingly frequent and invasive searches at the U.S. border have raised questions for those of us who want to protect the private data on our computers, phones, and other digital devices. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; released today by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) gives travelers the facts they need in order to prepare for border crossings while protecting their digital information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital Privacy at the U.S. Border” helps everyone do a risk assessment, evaluating personal factors like immigration status, travel history, and the sensitivity of the data you are carrying. Depending on which devices come with you on your trip, your gadgets can include information like your client files for work, your political leanings and those of your friends, and even your tax return. Assessing your risk factors helps you choose a path to proactively protect yourself, which might mean leaving some devices at home, moving some information off of your devices and into the cloud, and using encryption. EFF’s guide also explains why some protections, like fingerprint locking of a phone, are less secure than other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Border agents have more power than police officers normally do, and people crossing the border have less privacy than they usually expect,” said EFF Staff Attorney Sophia Cope. “Border agents may demand that you unlock your phone, provide your laptop password, or disclose your social media handles. Yet this is where many of us store our most sensitive personal information. We hope this guide makes preparing for your trip and protecting your devices easier and more effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many travelers are confused about what is legal at the border, and the consequences for running afoul of a border agent can run the gamut from indefinite seizure of your phone and computer, to denial of entry for foreign visitors, although American citizens always have the right to re-enter the country. EFF’s new guide hopes to clear up misinformation while recognizing that there is no “one size fits all” approach to crossing into the United States. In addition to the full report, EFF has also created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-border-search-pocket-guide&quot;&gt;pocket guide&lt;/a&gt; for helping people concerned with data protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The border is not a Constitution-free zone, but sometimes the rules are less protective of travelers and some border agents can be aggressive,” said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Adam Schwartz. “That can put unprepared travelers in a no-win dilemma at the U.S. border. We need &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/demand-border-agents-get-a-warrant-before-digital-searches&quot;&gt;clearer legal protections&lt;/a&gt; for everyone, but in the meantime, our report and pocket guides aim to put more power back into the hands of travelers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU Internet Advocates Launch Campaign to Stop Dangerous Copyright Filtering Proposal</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/eu-internet-advocates-launch-campaign-stop-eus-dangerous-copyright-filtering</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the European Commission’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/upload-filtering-mandate-would-shred-european-copyright-safe-harbor&quot;&gt;dangerous proposal&lt;/a&gt; to require user-generated content platforms to filter user uploads for copyright infringement, European digital rights advocates are calling on Internet users throughout Europe to stand up for freedom of expression online by urging their MEP (Member of European Parliament) to stop the #CensorshipMachine and &lt;a href=&quot;https://savethememe.net/&quot;&gt;“save the meme.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the European Commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/upload-filtering-mandate-would-shred-european-copyright-safe-harbor&quot;&gt;released a proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market&lt;/a&gt;, Article 13 of which would require all online service providers that “store and provide to the public access to large amounts of works or other subject-matter uploaded by their users” to reach agreements with rights holders to keep allegedly infringing content off their sites – including by implementing content filtering technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/european-copyright-leak-exposes-plans-force-internet-subsidize-publishers&quot;&gt;at length&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/11/users-around-world-reject-europes-upload-filtering-proposal&quot;&gt;the dangers of this proposal&lt;/a&gt;, and the problems &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything&quot;&gt;with filtering the Internet for copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, it’s extremely dangerous for fair use and free expression online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, two EU-based organizations are calling on Internet users to stand up for their rights to lawfully use copyrighted works, and to call on the European Parliament to remove Article 13 from the proposed directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bof.nl/home/english-bits-of-freedom/&quot;&gt;Bits of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, a Netherlands-based organization, launched a campaign website where you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://savethememe.net/&quot;&gt;“save the meme”&lt;/a&gt; by contacting an MEP and urging them to delete Article 13.  The site calls attention to the proposed directive’s impact on popular legal uses of copyrighted content, &lt;a href=&quot;https://savethememe.net/&quot;&gt;“like parody, citations and –oh, noes! – memes,”&lt;/a&gt; and provides a handy tool for getting in touch with your MEP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the activist group &lt;a href=&quot;https://xnet-x.net/en/&quot;&gt;Xnet&lt;/a&gt;, with support from EFF, EDRi, and several other digital rights groups released &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qAcTeYtUzQY&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; highlighting how Article 13 would give copyright holders the ability to censor a wide swath of online expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Digital rights advocates aren’t the only ones seeing problems with this proposal. Article 13 has been criticized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2850483&quot;&gt;academics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.create.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OpenLetter_EU_Copyright_Reform_22_02_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;academic research centers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/silicon-allee/eu-copyright-reform-is-coming-is-your-startup-ready-4be81a5fabf7#.p3qr2vns2&quot;&gt;members of the EU’s startup community&lt;/a&gt; as well. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmedia.org/en/press/imco-committee-recommends-eu-parliament-reject-plans-link-tax-warns-content-filtering-harms&quot;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, an important committee charged with reviewing the proposal, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;amp;reference=PE-599.682&amp;amp;format=PDF&amp;amp;language=EN&amp;amp;secondRef=01&quot;&gt;European Parliament Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection&lt;/a&gt;, criticized Article 13 as “incompatible with the limited liability regime” currently in effect in the EU under the e-Commerce Directive, legislation the committee refers to as “enormously beneficial.” The committee’s report warns of Article 13’s “negative impacts on the digital economy [and] internet freedoms of consumers, ” as well as its potential effect on market entry for online services. The Committee also criticized the proposal’s call to implement technological filtering solutions, explaining “[t]he use of filtering potentially harms the interests of users, as there are many legitimate uses of copyright content that filtering technologies are often not advanced enough to accommodate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still time to stop Article 13 before it becomes law in the EU. The proposed directive must pass through several more rounds of review by European Parliament Committees, followed by an informal “trialogue”, where the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the Council of the European Union try to agree on the text of the directive, before it finally moves to consideration by Parliament. If you’re in Europe, you can take action to stop Article 13 by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://savethememe.net/&quot;&gt;savethememe.net&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not, you can share that link with your European friends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is Trying to Roll Back Internet Privacy Protections As You Read This</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-trying-roll-back-internet-privacy-protections-you-read</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action callout-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call congress now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014 over 3 million Internet users told the U.S. government loudly and clearly: we value our online security, we value our online privacy, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/huge-win-open-internet-fcc-officially-embraces-title-ii&quot;&gt;we value net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. Our voices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/fcc-votes-net-neutrality-big-win&quot;&gt;helped convince the FCC to enact smart net neutrality regulations&lt;/a&gt;—including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/network-neutrality-2016&quot;&gt;long-needed privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it appears some members of Congress didn’t get the message, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/congress-contemplating-making-it-illegal-protect-consumer-privacy-online&quot;&gt;they’re trying to roll back the FCC’s privacy rules&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;right now &lt;/i&gt;without having anything concrete ready to replace them. We’re talking here about basic requirements, like getting your explicit consent before using your private information to do anything other than provide you with Internet access (such as targeted advertising).  Given how much private information your ISP has about you, strict limits on what they do with it are essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we can stop this train wreck before it happens. But &lt;b&gt;we need your help&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;please call your senators and your representative right now&lt;/a&gt; and tell them to oppose any use of the Congressional Review Act (“the CRA”—they’ll know what it is) to roll back the FCC’s new rules about ISP privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more ammo for your conversation with congressional staff, read on. But if you’re already fired up, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;click here to take action right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we can stop Congress from undermining crucial privacy protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&#039;s the tl;dr?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, the FCC passed rules that would require ISPs to protect your private information. It covered the things you would usually associate with having an account with a major company (your name and address, financial information, etc.) but also things like any records they keep on your browsing history, geolocation information (think cell phones), and the content of your communications. Overall, the rules were pretty darn good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, Senator Flake (R-AZ) and Representative Blackburn (R-TN) want to use a tool known as a Congressional Review Act resolution to totally repeal those protections. The CRA allows Congress to veto any regulation written by a federal agency (like the FCC). Worse yet, it forbids the agency from passing any “substantially similar” regulations in the future, so the FCC would be forbidden from &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; trying to regulate ISP privacy practices. At the same time, some courts have limited the Federal Trade Commission’s ability protect your privacy, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hands of two federal agencies tied, ISPs themselves would be largely in change of protecting their customer’s privacy. In other words, the fox will be guarding the henhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we seem a little insistent that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;take action to stop this&lt;/a&gt;, that’s because we sincerely believe that together, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; stop this disaster before it comes to pass. Every time someone calls their representative or senators, &lt;del&gt;an angel gets its wings&lt;/del&gt; we’re one step closer to protecting the privacy of all U.S. Internet users. If we raise our voices the same way we did when it came to passing net neutrality, Congress won’t be able to ignore us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/modules/custom/eff_digital_voices/plugins/take_action/images/button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Action&quot; title=&quot;Take Action&quot; class=&quot;eff_digital_voices-take_action&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call congress now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy&quot;&gt;take action and call your senator and representative&lt;/a&gt; today, and tell them not to use the CRA to repeal the FCC’s privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Expert Panel Explores Tech Policy at the White House</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/panel-explores-tech-policy-white-house</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2017/03/06/nac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Nicole Wong talks tech and government with Alex Macgillivray and Cindy Cohn.&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 2, EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn sat down with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricoleur.org/2017/02/bio.html&quot;&gt;Alexander Macgillivray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolesbio.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Nicole Wong&lt;/a&gt;, both former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officers (CTO) under President Obama as well as former legal counsel for Google and Twitter. The panel explored the development of the Obama administration’s policies on the Internet, intellectual property, and digital privacy and speculated on the future of the White House CTO position under President Trump. On March 3rd, we learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/thiels-chief-of-staff-tapped-as-white-house-deputy-cto/&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel&#039;s former chief of staff Michael Kratsios&lt;/a&gt; will be stepping in to the role formerly held by Macgillivray and Wong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both panelists underscored the contributions that technologists can make in civil service and that law and policymakers need informed voices in the room and at the table. &quot;It&#039;s incumbent upon [the tech community] to start engaging&quot; said Wong. &quot;I think the technical talent within government is getting much better&quot; and part of that comes from convening the right people within government agencies—including those who are more technologically sophisticated—who understand the issues at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macgillivray also stressed the impact that the tech community at large can have on government policy, stating &quot;the engineering community, as it becomes more powerful, will be able to exercise more moral and political muscle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch below for the full discussion touching upon diverse digital civil liberties issues including net neutrality, device searches at the border, predictive policing algorithms, and more:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secret Court Orders Aren&#039;t Blank Checks for General Electronic Searches</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/gartenlaub</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: the government, for reasons you don&#039;t know, thinks you&#039;re a spy. You go on vacation and, while you&#039;re away, government agents secretly enter your home, search it, make copies of all your electronic devices, and leave. Those agents then turn those devices upside down, looking through decades worth of your files, photos, and online activity saved on your devices. They don&#039;t find any evidence that you&#039;re a spy, but they find something else—evidence of another, totally unrelated crime. You&#039;re arrested, charged, and ultimately convicted, yet you&#039;re never allowed to see what prompted the agents to think you were a spy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like something from dystopian fiction, right? Yet it&#039;s exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-national-security-powers-are-underpinning-some-ordinary-criminal-cases/2016/04/05/1a7685f4-fa36-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html?&quot;&gt;what happened to Keith Gartenlaub&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2014, the FBI secretly entered Gartenlaub&#039;s home while he and his wife were on vacation in China. Agents scoured the home, taking pictures, searching through boxes and books, and—critically—making wholesale copies of his hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents were authorized by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (&quot;FISC&quot;) to search for evidence that Gartenlaub was spying for the Chinese government. There’s only one problem with that theory: the government has never publicly produced any evidence to support it. Nevertheless, Gartenlaub now sits in jail. Not for spying, but because the FBI’s forensic search of his hard drives turned up roughly 100 files containing child pornography, buried among thousands of other files, saved on an external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartenlaub was tried and convicted, and he appealed his conviction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. EFF (along with our friends at the ACLU) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/brief-amici-curiae-electronic-frontier-foundation-and-american-civil-liberties-union&quot;&gt;recently filed an amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in support of his appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of troubling aspects to Gartenlaub’s prosecution and conviction. For one, and unlike normal criminal prosecutions, neither Gartenlaub nor his lawyers have ever seen the affidavit and order issued by the FISC that authorized the search of his home. There are also legitimate concerns about the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we got involved for a different reason: to weigh in on the Fourth Amendment implications of the FBI’s searches of Gartenlaub’s electronic devices. The unusual facts of this case gave us an unusually good opportunity to push for greater Fourth Amendment protections in all searches of electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why: when agents copied and searched Gartenlaub’s devices, they were only authorized to search for national security-related information. But the prosecution that resulted from those searches and seizures had nothing to do with national security at all. So, either the FBI seized information that was outside of the warrant (which the Fourth Amendment prohibits); or it was relying on an exception to the warrant requirement, like “plain view”—an exception that allows law enforcement to seize immediately obvious contraband when the government is in a place to lawfully observe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain view makes sense in the physical world. If cops are executing a search warrant for a home to search for drugs, they shouldn’t have to ignore the dead body lying in the living room. But the way plain view works in the digital context—especially forensic computer searches—is not at all clear. How far can cops rummage around our computers for the evidence they’re authorized to look for? Does a warrant to search for evidence of drug dealing allow cops to open all the photos stored on our computer? Does an order authorizing a search for national security information let the government rifle through a digital porn collection? And where do we draw the line between a specific search, based on probable cause for specific information stored on a computer—which the Fourth Amendment allows— and a general search for evidence of criminal activity—which the Fourth Amendment prohibits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our electronic devices contain decades&#039; worth of personal information about us. And, in many ways, searches of our electronic devices can be &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; intrusive than searches of our homes: there is information stored on our phones, computers, and hard drives, about our interests, our political thoughts, our sexual orientations, or religious beliefs, that might never have been previously stored in our homes—or, for that matter, anywhere at all. Because of the sensitivity of this data, we need clear restrictions on law enforcement searches of our electronic devices, so that every search doesn&#039;t turn into the type of general rummaging the Fourth Amendment was designed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our brief, we argued this case gave the Court a perfect opportunity to set a clear rule. We argued that the FBI’s search of Gartenlaub’s hard drives for evidence of regular, domestic crimes violated the Fourth Amendment, and we urged the Court to adopt a rule that would prohibit the FBI from using evidence that it obtained that was outside the scope of the initial search authorization. This would be a promising first step in limiting law enforcement’s electronic search powers and in protecting our right to privacy in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hey CIA, You Held On To Security Flaw Information—But Now It&#039;s Out. That&#039;s Not How It Should Work</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/hey-cia-you-held-security-flaw-information-now-its-out-thats-not-how-it-should</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wikileaks today released documents that appear to describe software tools used by the CIA to break into the devices that we all use at home and work. While we are still reviewing the material, we have not seen any indications that the encryption of popular privacy apps such as Signal and WhatsApp has been broken. We believe that encryption still offers significant protection against surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The worst thing that could happen is for users to lose faith in encryption-enabled tools and stop using them. The releases do reaffirm that users should make sure they are using the most current version of the apps on their devices.  And vendors should move quickly to patch these flaws to protect users from both government and criminal attackers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dark side of this story is that the documents confirm that the CIA holds on to security vulnerabilities in software and devices—including Android phones, iPhones, and Samsung televisions—that millions of people around the world rely on. The agency appears to have failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities to responsible vendors and failed to follow even the limited Vulnerabilities Equities Process. As these leaks show, we&#039;re all made less safe by the CIA&#039;s decision to keep --  rather than ensure the patching of -- vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
